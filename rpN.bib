abstract = {The EEG is one of the most commonly used tools in brain research. Though of high relevance in research, the data obtained is very noisy and nonstationary. In the present article we investigate the applicability of a nonlinear data analysis method, the recurrence quantification analysis (RQA), to such data. The method solely rests on the natural property of recurrence which is a phenomenon inherent to complex systems, such as the brain. We show that this method is indeed suitable for the analysis of EEG data and that it might improve contemporary EEG analysis.},

abstract = {Pregnant mothers often report a special awareness of and bonding with their unborn child. Little is known about this relationship although it may offer potential for the assessment of the fetal condition. Recently we found evidence of short epochs of fetal-maternal heart rate synchronization under uncontrolled conditions with spontaneous maternal breathing. Here, we examine whether the occurrence of such epochs can be influenced by maternal respiratory arrhythmia induced by paced breathing at several different rates (10, 12, 15, and 20 cycles per minute). To test for such weak and nonstationary synchronizations among the fetal-maternal subsystems, we apply a multivariate synchronization analysis technique and test statistics based on twin surrogates. We find a clear increase in synchronization epochs mostly at high maternal respiratory rates in the original but not in the surrogate data. On the other hand, fewer epochs are found at low respiratory rates both in original and surrogate data. The results suggest that the fetal cardiac system seems to possess the capability to adjust its rate of activation in response to external {\&}ndash; i.e., maternal{\&}ndash;stimulation. Hence, the pregnant mothers' special awareness to the unborn child may also be reflected by fetal-maternal interaction of cardiac activity. Our approach opens up the chance to examine this interaction between independent but closely linked physiological systems.},

abstract = {We propose a criterion to detect determinism in short time series. This criterion is based on the estimation of the parameter E2 defined by the averaged false neighbors method for analyzing time series [Cao, Physica D 110, 43 (1997)]. Using surrogate data testing with several chaotic and stochastic simulated time series, we show that the variation coefficient of E2 over a few values of the embedding dimension d defines a suitable statistic to detect determinism in short data sequences. This result holds for a time series generated by a high-dimensional chaotic system such as the Mackey-Glass one. Different decreasing lengths of the time series are included in the numerical experiments for both synthetic and real-world data. We also investigate the robustness of the criterion in the case of deterministic time series corrupted by additive noise.},

Existing recurrence plot analysis techniques, which are primarily application oriented and completely quantitative, require that the time-series data first be embedded in a high-dimensional space, where the embedding dimension dE is dictated by the dimension d of the data set, with dE {\textgreater}= 2d + 1. One such set of recurrence plot analysis tools, recurrence quantification analysis, is particularly useful in finding locations in the data where the underlying dynamics change.

First, we reduce the artefacts in the scalp EEG using a novel filter that combines wavelet transforms and empirical mode decomposition. Then, the determinism in the recurrence plot is calculated. It is found that the determinism increases gradually with increasing the concentration of sevoflurane. Finally, a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PKPD) model is built to describe the relationship between the concentration of sevoflurane and the processed EEG measure ('determinism' of the recurrence plot). A test sample of nine patients shows the recurrence in EEG data may track the effect of the sevoflurane on the brain.},

In this paper, {\&}epsilon; is inversely computed from a given recurrence rate (REC), the percentage of recurrence points. From the inversely computed {\&}epsilon;, two other RQA output variables: determinism (DET), the percentage of recurrence points forming diagonal line structures, and laminarity (LAM), the percentage of recurrence points forming vertical and horizontal structures, are computed out as well. The trend of DET, LAM values at different REC levels (DLR trend) is introduced to comprehensively represent the dynamic properties of a time series. Based on the DLR trend, the variation of discrimination power, represented by the average loss (or Bayes risk), of DET and LAM, at different REC values is analyzed. Surrogate techniques are used to generate reliable test data sets for the discrimination evaluation. In particular, the results show that (1) the optimal REC can be much higher than the widely used 1{\%} REC, and (2) after the optimization, the average loss can be reduced compared to 1{\%} REC. It is also demonstrated that the optimal {\&}epsilon; depends on the dynamic source and RQA variables, and the DLR trend based {\&}epsilon; optimization method can improve RQA discrimination analysis especially for the short term HRV analysis.},

Seeking for predictability, in this paper, the characteristics of these fluctuations are investigated through time series analysis methods. The results of analyses are representative of the existence of a deterministic chaos in the system with a mimic predictability. Besides, it is observed that because of existing the seasonality and non-stationarity in the system dynamics, a fixed model cannot perform properly even in case of normalized input data, but the developed models should be updated regularly.},

The primary structures of 19 rubredoxins of both mesophilic and thermophilic bacteria, coded with hydrophobicity values of amino acid residues, were considered as time series and were analyzed by 1) recurrence quantification analysis and 2) spectral analysis of the sequence major eigenfunctions. The results of the two methods agreed to a large extent and generated a classification consistent with known 3D structural characteristics of the studied proteins. This classification separated in a clearcut manner a thermophilic protein from mesophilic proteins. The classification of primary structures given by the two dynamical methods was demonstrated to be basically different from classification stemming from classical sequence homology metrics. Moreover, on a more detailed scale, the method was able to discriminate between thermophilic and mesophilic proteins from a set of chimeric sequences generated from the mixing of a mesophilic (Rubr Clopa) and a thermophilic (Rubr Pyrfu) protein. Overall, our results point to a new way of looking at protein sequence comparisons.},

In this paper we report identification of phase synchronization in coupled time-delay systems exhibiting hyperchaotic attractor. We show that there is a transition from nonsynchronized behavior to phase and then to generalized synchronization as a function of coupling strength. These transitions are characterized by recurrence quantification analysis, by phase differences based on a transformation of the attractors, and also by the changes in the Lyapunov exponents.

abstract = {This study aimed to assess the capacity of recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) to detect potentiation and to determine the fatigue components to which RQA is sensitive. Fifteen men were divided in two groups [8 endurance-trained athletes (END) and 7 power-trained athletes (POW)]. They performed a 10-min intermittent (5 s contraction, 5 s rest) knee extension exercise at 50{\%} of their maximal voluntary isometric contraction. Muscular fatigue and potentiation were evaluated with neurostimulation technique. Mechanical (peak torque, Pt) and electrophysiological (M-wave) responses following electrical stimulation of the femoral nerve were measured at rest and every 10 s throughout exercise. Vastus lateralis muscle activity (root mean square, RMS) was recorded during each contraction, and RMS was normalized to M-wave area (RMS/M). During contraction, muscle activity was analyzed with RQA to obtain the percentage of determinism ({\%}Det). At the beginning of exercise, a significant Pt increase (+52{\%}, {\textless}i{\textgreater}P{\textless}/i{\textgreater} {\textless} 0.001) was observed in both groups, indicating potentiation. At this time, {\%}Det remained constant in both groups, indicating that RQA did not detect potentiation.

Essentially, this is a transformation from the time domain to the network domain, which allows for the dynamics of the time series to be studied via organization of the network. In this paper, we focus on the deterministic chaotic R�ssler time series and stochastic noisy periodic data that yield substantially different structures of networks. In particular, we test an extensive range of network topology statistics, which have not been discussed in previous work, but which are capable of providing a comprehensive statistical characterization of the dynamics from different angles. Our goal is to find out how they reflect and quantify different aspects of specific dynamics, and how they can be used to distinguish different dynamical regimes. For example, we find that the joint degree distribution appears to fundamentally characterize spatial organizations of cycles in phase space, and this is quantified via an assortativity coefficient. We applied network statistics to electrocardiograms of a healthy individual and an arrythmia patient. Such time series are typically pseudoperiodic, but are noisy and nonstationary and degrade traditional phase-space based methods. These time series are, however, better differentiated by our network-based statistics.},

The electroencephalogram (EEG) from rabbits was embedded in phase space and local recurrence plots were calculated and quantified using recurrence quantitation analysis to permit statistical comparisons between filtered segments of exposed and control epochs from individual rabbits. When the rabbits were exposed to the radiation from a standard cellular telephone (800 MHz band, 600 mW maximum radiated power) under conditions that simulated normal human use, the EEG was significantly affected in nine of ten animals studied. The effect occurred beginning about 100 ms after initiation of application of the field and lasted 300 ms. In each case, the fields increased the randomness in the EEG. A control procedure ruled out the possibility that the observations were a product of the method of analysis. No differences were found between exposed and control epochs in any animal when the experiment was repeated after the rabbits had been sacrificed, indicating that absorption of radiation by the EEG electrodes could not account for the observed effect. No effect was seen when deposition of energy in the brain was minimized by repositioning the radiating antenna from the head to the chest, showing that the type of tissue that absorbed the energy determined the observed changes in the EEG. We conclude that, in normal use, the fields from a standard cellular telephone can alter brain function as a consequence of absorption of energy by the brain.},

Conventional static models are inadequate to model manufacturing system performance variations in real-time from these large non-stationary data sources. This paper addresses a physics-based approach to model the performance outputs (e.g., throughputs, uptimes, and yield rates) from a multi-stage manufacturing system. Unlike previous methods, degradation and repair dynamics that influence downtime distributions in such manufacturing systems are explicitly considered. Sigmoid function theory is used to remove discontinuities in the models. The resulting model is validated using real-world datasets acquired from the General Motorpsilas assembly lines, and it is found to capture dynamics of downtime better than traditional exponential distribution based simulation models.},

abstract = {Irradiation effects on tracking resistance of polymer insulation materials should be investigated due to the increasing usage in radiation-prone environments. This paper presents a study on dc tracking resistance of gamma-ray irradiated polycarbonate mixed with polyethylene by use of IEC 60112 method. The samples were irradiated in air up to 100 kGy and 1000 kGy with a dosage rate of 10 kGy/h using a 60Co gamma source. Because the data of tracking resistance obtained from the tracking test has a wide variation, discharge current in the test is considered as a main factor to estimate the tracking resistance. A recurrence plot analysis of discharge current has been made to evaluate the tracking resistance more consistently. Obtained results showed that after gamma-ray irradiation, the tracking resistance was improved compared with that of the unirradiated sample. The tracking resistance showed an increasing tendency from 0 kGy to 100 kGy but a decreasing tendency from 100 kGy to 1000 kGy. There was a threshold value for the tracking resistance around 100 kGy, which was related to the reaction of cross-linking and degradation. The topological structures of the recurrence plots with the irradiated samples were different from that of the unirradiated one. There were bigger white space segments, which indicated that there were high amplitude transients in the discharge currents of unirradiated sample. The recurrence point density increased from 100 kGy to 1000 kGy, which suggested that the discharge process of the total dose at 1000 kGy was more intensive than that at 100 kGy. The irradiation effects on the tracking resistance can be visually identified by the recurrence plot.},

abstract = {Characterizing locomotor dynamics is essential for understanding the neuromuscular control of locomotion. In particular, quantifying dynamic stability during walking is important for assessing people who have a greater risk of falling. However, traditional biomechanical methods of defining stability have not quantified the resistance of the neuromuscular system to perturbations, suggesting that more precise definitions are required. For the present study, average maximum finite-time Lyapunov exponents were estimated to quantify the local dynamic stability of human walking kinematics. Local scaling exponents, defined as the local slopes of the correlation sum curves, were also calculated to quantify the local scaling structure of each embedded time series. Comparisons were made between overground and motorized treadmill walking in young healthy subjects and between diabetic neuropathic (NP) patients and healthy controls (CO) during overground walking. A modification of the method of surrogate data was developed to examine the stochastic nature of the fluctuations overlying the nominally periodic patterns in these data sets. Results demonstrated that having subjects walk on a motorized treadmill artificially stabilized their natural locomotor kinematics by small but statistically significant amounts. Furthermore, a paradox previously present in the biomechanical literature that resulted from mistakenly equating variability with dynamic stability was resolved. By slowing their self-selected walking speeds, NP patients adopted more locally stable gait patterns, even though they simultaneously exhibited greater kinematic variability than CO subjects. Additionally, the loss of peripheral sensation in NP patients was associated with statistically significant differences in the local scaling structure of their walking kinematics at those length scales where it was anticipated that sensory feedback would play the greatest role. Lastly, stride-to-stride fluctuations in the walking patterns of all three subject groups were clearly distinguishable from linearly autocorrelated Gaussian noise. As a collateral benefit of the methodological approach taken in this study, some of the first steps at characterizing the underlying structure of human locomotor dynamics have been taken. Implications for understanding the neuromuscular control of locomotion are discussed.},

In particular, we address the automatic identification of cover songs, i.e. alternative renditions of a previously recorded musical piece. For this purpose we here propose a recurrence quantification analysis measure that allows tracking potentially curved and disrupted traces in cross recurrence plots. We apply this measure to cross recurrence plots constructed from the state space representation of musical descriptor time series extracted from the raw audio signal. We show that our method identifies cover songs with a higher accuracy as compared to previously published techniques. Beyond the particular application proposed here, we discuss how our approach can be useful for the characterization of a variety of signals from different scientific disciplines.

We show that if one defines a typical event in one oscillator and then observes another one whenever this event occurs, these observations give rise to a localized set. Our result provides a general and easy way to identify PS, which can also be used to oscillators that possess multiple time scales. We illustrate our approach in networks of chemically coupled neurons. We show that clusters of phase synchronous neurons may emerge before the onset of phase synchronization in the whole network, producing a suitable environment for information exchanging. Furthermore, we show the relation between the localized sets and the amount of information that coupled chaotic oscillator can exchange.},

Among these measures, the recurrence rate, quantifying the percentage of black points in the plot, is applied to characterize the stickiness of a typical chaotic orbit. The advantage of the recurrence based method in comparison to other standard techniques is that it is possible to distinguish between quasiperiodic and chaotic orbits that are temporarily trapped in a sticky domain, from very short trajectories.},

We describe a method for detecting a stimulus-related change in brain electrical activity that persists while the stimulus is present (presence effect). The method, which is based on phase-space embedding of the EEG time series followed by quantitative analysis of the recurrence plot of the embedded signal, was used to demonstrate the occurrence of a presence effect in separate groups of human subjects exposed to sound, a magnetic field, and light. Any form of law-governed dynamical activity induced in the EEG can be detected, particularly activity that is nonlinearly related to the stimulus.

Living systems are governed by numerous, continuously changing, interacting variables in the presence of noise. Cardiovascular signals can be shown to be discontinuous alternations between deterministic trajectories and stochastic pauses (terminal dynamics). One promising approach for assessing such nondeterministic complexity is recurrence quantification analysis (RQA). As reviewed in this paper, strategies implementing quantification of recurrences have been successful in diagnosing changes in nonstationary cardiac signals not easily detected by traditional methods. It is concluded that recurrence quantification analysis is a powerful discriminatory tool which, when properly applied to cardiac signals, can provide objectivity regarding the degree of determinism characterizing the system, state changes, as well as degrees of complexity and/or randomness.},

The advantages of this automatic real-time approach are that obtaining speech data is nonobstrusive and is free from sensor application and calibration efforts. Different types of acoustic features derived from speech, speaker, and emotion recognition were employed (frame-level-based speech features). Combing these features with high-level contour descriptors, which capture the temporal information of frame-level descriptor contours, results in 45,088 features per speech sample. In general, the measurement process follows the speech-adapted steps of pattern recognition: (1) recording speech, (2) preprocessing, (3) feature computation (using perceptual and signal-processing-related features such as, e.g., fundamental frequency, intensity, pause patterns, formants, and cepstral coefficients), (4) dimensionality reduction, (5) classification, and (6) evaluation. After a correlation-filter-based feature subset selection employed on the feature space in order to find most relevant features, different classification models were trained.

abstract = {Purpose: Historically, F-waves have been classified by various linear descriptors like persistence, latency, duration, amplitude, chrono-dispersion and number of repeater waves. But because physiological signals are notoriously nonlinear in nature, the objective of this study was to apply modern nonlinear methodology to F-waves sequences to assess the presence of underlying deterministic structures. Subtle changes in these sensitive markers could give early warnings for neurological problems. Methods: F-waves were elicited in the left abductor pollicis breivs muscle by supra-maximally stimulating the median nerve percutaneously at the wrist. Approximately 200 stimuli were applied (0.5 Hz) to three subjects for at least four trials each. F-wave latencies were measured and assembled into sequences in proper order. Recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) was applied to these F-wave sequences from different dimensional perspectives. Controls were constructed by randomly shuffling the ordered sequences. RQA has a theoretical mathematical foundation and practical performance record on numerous other physiological systems. Results: Recurrence analysis showed that sequential F-waves form recurrent patterns with parallel trajectories with deterministic and laminated structures. These features could be destroyed by randomizing the sequential orders of F-waves, upholding the hypothesis that sequences of F-waves are deterministically formed from underlying physiological rules. Conclusions: F-wave time series are fully amenable to recurrence analysis which provides a higher- dimensional perspective on the physiological dynamic. The recurrent patterns are complex, but not random, meaning that physiological rules dominate the sequence of F-waves. Disease processes within the central or peripheral nervous system may alter F-wave patterns. If so, RQA potentially may be a diagnostic tool to help discern subtleties between altered deterministic rules operating in disease'.},

@article{gilmore98,
abstract = {Topological methods have recently been developed for the analysis of dissipative dynamical systems that operate in the chaotic regime. They were originally developed for three-dimensional dissipative dynamical systems, but they are applicable to all "low-dimensional" dynamical systems. These are systems for which the flow rapidly relaxes to a three-dimensional subspace of phase space. Equivalently, the associated attractor has Lyapunov dimension dL{\textless}3. Topological methods supplement methods previously developed to determine the values of metric and dynamical invariants. However, topological methods possess three additional features: they describe how to model the dynamics; they allow validation of the models so developed; and the topological invariants are robust under changes in control-parameter values. The topological-analysis procedure depends on identifying the stretching and squeezing mechanisms that act to create a strange attractor and organize all the unstable periodic orbits in this attractor in a unique way. The stretching and squeezing mechanisms are represented by a caricature, a branched manifold, which is also called a template or a knot holder. This turns out to be a version of the dynamical system in the limit of infinite dissipation. This topological structure is identified by a set of integer invariants. One of the truly remarkable results of the topological-analysis procedure is that these integer invariants can be extracted from a chaotic time series. Furthermore, self-consistency checks can be used to confirm the integer values. These integers can be used to determine whether or not two dynamical systems are equivalent; in particular, they can determine whether a model developed from time-series data is an accurate representation of a physical system. Conversely, these integers can be used to provide a model for the dynamical mechanisms that generate chaotic data. In fact, the author has constructed a doubly discrete classification of strange attractors. The underlying branched manifold provides one discrete classification. Each branched manifold has an "unfolding" or perturbation in which some subset of orbits is removed. The remaining orbits are determined by a basis set of orbits that forces the presence of all remaining orbits. Branched manifolds and basis sets of orbits provide this doubly discrete classification of strange attractors. In this review the author describes the steps that have been developed to implement the topological-analysis procedure. In addition, the author illustrates how to apply this procedure by carrying out the analysis of several experimental data sets. The results obtained for several other experimental time series that exhibit chaotic behavior are also described.},

abstract = {Computational chemistry is largely based on the use of quantitative descriptors of organic molecules, allowing for the analysis of large molecular data sets and for building models that link the chemico-physical and structural descriptions of molecules to their biological activity or chemical reactivity. In the case of the proteins, this approach is severely hampered by the need to take into consideration in a meaningful way, the actual sequence of the aminoacid residues. From a purely mathematical perspective, the protein sequences can be viewed as a time series, where the role of time is played by the order of the aminoacid residues along the sequences. In turn, each individual residue can be considered as a single organic molecule that can be represented by the classical molecular descriptors. Thus, in principle the generation of order-dependent synthetic descriptors through the application of time series analysis can be used for building QSAR-like models of proteins. As a matter of fact, Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) of hydrophobicity-coded sequences of proteins has already been demonstrated to be useful in protein science. In this paper, we show merits and pitfalls of RQA in different case studies, ranging from the global description of a large set of diverse proteins, to the study of the effect of mutations in the human cytochrome P450 system.},

Ground reaction force (vertical component) was recorded using a force plate. The sEMG was analysed in the frequency domain and the median frequency (MDF) was computed over successive 1 s epochs. A non-linear technique, recurrence quantification analysis was also applied to assess the presence and time course of deterministic structures in sEMG. The percentage of determinism ({\%}DET) was used as a synthetic parameter to quantify the amount of regularly repeating sEMG waves within the signal itself (bursts). In 5 WLA the sEMG displayed a clear burst activity centred at 11 Hz. These bursts were correlated with force output oscillations and were evident both at 30{\%} and 60{\%}MVC. The MDF decay with time was more evident in WLA than in CG subjects. The {\%}DET increased in WLA, this increase being more evident during 60{\%}MVC contractions.

This paper presents a recurrence plot-based traffic classification approach based on the analysis of non-stationary "chidden" transition patterns of IP traffic flows. Such nonlinear properties cannot be affected by payload encryption or dynamic port change and hence cannot be easily masqueraded. In performing a quantitative assessment of the above transition patterns, we used recurrence quantification analysis, a nonlinear technique widely used in many fields of science to discover the time correlations and the hidden dynamics of statistical time series. Our model proved to be effective for providing a deterministic interpretation of recurrence patterns derived by complex protocol dynamics in end-to-end traffic flows, and hence for developing qualitative and quantitative observations that can be reliably used in traffic classification.},

abstract = {Recurrence plots provide a graphical representation of the recurrent patterns in a timeseries, the quantification of which is a relatively new field. Here we derive analytical expressions which relate the values of key statistics, notably determinism and entropy of line length distribution, to the correlation sum as a function of embedding dimension. These expressions are obtained by deriving the transformation which generates an embedded recurrence plot from an unembedded plot. A single unembedded recurrence plot thus provides the statistics of all possible embedded recurrence plots. If the correlation sum scales exponentially with embedding dimension, we show that these statistics are determined entirely by the exponent of the exponential. This explains the results of Iwanski and Bradley [J.S. Iwanski, E. Bradley, Recurrence plots of experimental data: to embed or not to embed? Chaos 8 (1998) 861-871] who found that certain recurrence plot statistics are apparently invariant to embedding dimension for certain low-dimensional systems. We also examine the relationship between the mutual information content of two timeseries and the common recurrent structure seen in their recurrence plots. This allows time-localized contributions to mutual information to be visualized. This technique is demonstrated using geomagnetic index data; we show that the AU and AL geomagnetic indices share half their information, and find the timescale on which mutual features appear.},

abstract = {One of the common routes to chaos is intermittency. Identification of the intermittency type is usually made using the properties of the probability distribution of laminar phases and of the average length of the laminar phases. Both have a statistical character and to obtain them a long time series has to be examined. Here, we present a recurrence plot method applicable to the analysis of short time series and through which the type of intermittency may be identified. The three types of intermittency introduced by Pomeau and Manneville and a chaos-chaos intermittency induced by interior crisis were examined. The identification of the type of intermittency is equivalent to the identification of the bifurcation associated with it. Our result seems particularly interesting as our method allows the analysis of short time series. The effect of the measurement noise on the effectiveness of the method is also discussed. An application of the method to the detection of type I intermittency in measured heart rate variability data is discussed.},

abstract = {This paper concerns recognition of human actions under view changes. We explore self-similarities of action sequences over time and observe the striking stability of such measures across views. Building upon this key observation we develop an action descriptor that captures the structure of temporal similarities and dissimilarities within an action sequence. Despite this descriptor not being strictly view-invariant, we provide intuition and experimental validation demonstrating the high stability of self-similarities under view changes. Self-similarity descriptors are also shown stable under action variations within a class as well as discriminative for action recognition. Interestingly, self-similarities computed from different image features possess similar properties and can be used in a complementary fashion. Our method is simple and requires neither structure recovery nor multi-view correspondence estimation. Instead, it relies on weak geometric cues captured by self-similarities and combines them with machine learning for efficient cross-view action recognition. The method is validated on three public datasets, it has similar or superior performance compared to related methods and it performs well even in extreme conditions such as when recognizing actions from top views while using side views for training only.},

abstract = {Cardiac variability can be assessed from two perspectives: beat-to-beat performance and continuous performance during the cardiac cycle. Linear analysis techniques assess cardiac variability by measuring the physical attributes of a signal, whereas nonlinear techniques evaluate signal dynamics. This study sought to determine if recurrence quantification analysis (RQA), a nonlinear technique, could detect pharmacologically induced autonomic changes in the continuous left ventricular pressure (LVP) and electrographic (EC) signals from an isolated rat heart--a model that theoretically contains no inherent variability. LVP and EC signal data were acquired simultaneously during Langendorff perfusion of isolated rat hearts before and after the addition of acetylcholine (n = 11), norepinephrine (n = 12), or no drug (n = 12). Two-minute segments of the continuous LVP and EC signal data were analyzed by RQA. Findings showed that{\%}recurrence,{\%}determinism, entropy, maxline, and trend from the continuous LVP signal significantly increased in the presence of both acetylcholine and norepinephrine, although systolic LVP significantly increased only with norepinephrine. In the continuous EC signal, the RQA trend variable significantly increased in the presence of norepinephrine. These results suggest that when either the sympathetic or parasympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system overwhelms the other, the dynamics underlying cardiac variability become stationary. This study also shows that information concerning inherent variability in the isolated rat heart can be gained via RQA of the continuous cardiac signal. Although speculative, RQA may be a tool for detecting alterations in cardiac variability and evaluating signal dynamics as a nonlinear indicator of cardiac pathology.},

We then investigated the time structure of 6 Mediterranean bluefin tuna trap catches known to display long-term fluctuations. These time series showed significantly more determinism than linear stochastic processes, displaying more recurring patterns/states than stochastic surrogates. The short term structure of these series also showed a direct and delayed negative feedback in their rate of increase. These results were homogeneous over all studied time series. An interaction between climate forcing and the life history traits of bluefin tuna was postulated to explain the first result, while the density-dependent pattern may be explained either by density-dependence processes during early stages, or by non-successive (non-yearly) spawning events in the Mediterranean.},

Temporal pattern identification is based on the statistical treatment of the recurrent behavior of jointly considered volume and occupancy series; clustering is done via a two-level neural network approach. Results on urban signalized arterial 90-second traffic volume and occupancy data indicate that traffic pattern propagation exhibits variability with respect to its statistical characteristics such as deterministic structure and nonlinear evolution. Further, traffic pattern clustering uncovers four distinct classes of traffic pattern evolution, whereas transitional traffic conditions can be straightforwardly identified.},

The contribution of each of these types of mutations to tumor progression, grade of malignancy, and response to anticancer treatments has been so far analyzed only for a few hot-spots. In an attempt to identify new approaches to systematically characterize the complete spectrum of p53 mutations, we applied recurrence quantification analysis (RQA), a non-linear signal analysis technique, to p53 primary structure. Moving from the study of the p53 hydrophobicity pattern, which revealed important similarities with the singular deterministic structuring of prions, we could statistically discriminate, on a pure amino acid sequence basis, between experimentally characterized DNA-contact defective and conformational p53 mutants with a very high percentage of success. This result indicates that RQA is a mathematical tool particularly advantageous for the development of a database of p53 mutations that integrates epidemiological data with structural and functional categorizations.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of high degrees of motor unit synchronization on surface EMG variables extracted by linear and non-linear analysis techniques. For this purpose, spectral and recurrent quantification analysis (RQA) were applied to both simulated and experimental EMG signals. Synthetic surface EMG signals were generated with a model of volume conductor comprising muscle, fat, and skin tissues. The synchronization was quantified by the percent of discharges of each motor unit synchronized with discharges of other motor units. The simulated signals presented degrees of synchronization in the range 0-80{\%} (10{\%} increments) and three mean values of motor unit conduction velocity distribution (3, 4 and 5 m/s). Experimental signals were collected from the first dorsal interosseous muscle of five patients with Parkinson disease during 10 s of rest and 10 s of isometric voluntary contraction at 50{\%} of the maximal force. Mean power spectral frequency (MNF) and percent of determinism ({\%}DET) of the surface EMG were computed from the simulated and experimental signals. In the simulated signals, {\%}DET was linearly related to the level of synchronization in the entire range considered while MNF was sensitive to changes in synchronization in a smaller range (0-20{\%}), outside which it levelled off. The experimental results indicated that {\%}DET was significantly higher in the resting condition (with presence of tremor; mean ? S.E., 85.4 ? 0.8{\%}) than during the voluntary contraction (which partly suppressed tremor; 60.0 ? 2.3{\%}; P {\textless} 0.01). On the contrary, MNF did not depend on the condition (114.3 ? 1.5 Hz and 118.0 ? 0.8 Hz for the resting and voluntary contraction, respectively), confirming the simulation results. Overall, these results indicated that linear and non-linear analyses of the surface EMG may have different sensitivities to the underlying physiological mechanisms in specific conditions, thus their joint use provides a more complete view of the muscle status than spectral analysis only.},

abstract = {The systemic injection of L-Acetylcarnitine (L-Ac) induces a reversible increase in recurrent inhibition. In addition, L-Ac potentiation of recurrent inhibition has been found to increase the synchronous activity of single motor units, as detected by traditional linear analysis in the time domain. This result has been recently confirmed using a nonlinear method based on the analysis of embedded determinism ({\%}DET) extracted from the surface EMG. The present study aimed at testing the general applicability of RQA methodology, as a viable tool for assessing motor unit synchronization, by extending the analysis of surface EMG, as revealed by changes in {\%}DET induced by L-Ac, to many upper and lower limb muscles and to muscles that are not easily studied by needle electrodes, such as the orbicularis oculi. Subjects performed brief periods of tonic contractions, alternated to periods of rests to avoid muscle fatigue. Pharmacological enhancement of recurrent inhibition was obtained by a short-lasting intravenous injection of L-Ac. Control experiments were performed replacing L-Ac injection with saline injection. The average {\%}DET showed a significant increase during L-Ac injection in the deltoid, biceps brachii, extensor carpi radialis, while no effect was observed in the opponens pollicis and abductor digiti minimi for the upper limb muscles. Similarly, the average {\%}DET showed a significant increase during L-Ac injection in the quadriceps, soleus, and tibialis anterior, while no effect was observed in the abductor hallucis for the lower limb muscles. RQA of orbicularis oculi muscle activity showed no increase in {\%}DET during L-Ac injection in analogy to what found in the intrinsic muscles of the hand and foot, known to be devoid of recurrent inhibition. The presence or absence of drug-induced increase in motor unit synchronization agrees with the known distribution of recurrent inhibition in the various motor nuclei.

abstract = {Soil is usually presented as a complex dynamical system. Nevertheless, evidences based on the theoretical background of complex system physics are still scarce. The main objective of this work was to search for chaotic parameters using some basic concepts of nonlinear dynamical system theory with spatial series of soil properties. Three spatial series consisting of 1000 data point transects were used. We selected horizontal and vertical electrical conductivity (EC{\textless}sub{\textgreater}h{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} and EC{\textless}sub{\textgreater}v{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}, respectively) and gravimetric water content from a Vertisol (Typic Hapludert) under rice cropping. Each spatial transect was oriented from South to North with 1-m spacing. It was used the TISEAN Software Package (a public domain software available at http://www.mpipks-dresdren.mpg.de/{\~{}}tisean) for deriving nonlinear parameters from spatial series. We found interesting evidences of chaotic behaviour as maximal Lyapunov exponents were all positive. They ranged from {\textless}i{\textgreater}{\&}lambda;{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}m{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} = 0.129 for water content to {\textless}i{\textgreater}{\&}lambda;{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}m{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} = 0.219 for EC{\textless}sub{\textgreater}v{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} (filtered series in each case). Original (unfiltered), filtered{\textless}i{\textgreater},{\textless}/i{\textgreater} and surrogate spatial series confirmed these findings as they also showed positive Lyapunov exponents. All the spatial series showed a higher deterministic component (|{\textless}i{\textgreater}{\&}kappa;{\textless}/i{\textgreater}|{\textgreater} 0.9 in most cases). The Lyapunov range of correlation ({\textless}i{\textgreater}{\&}rho;{\textless}/i{\textgreater}) was within the limits 4.56 m (EC{\textless}sub{\textgreater}v{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}) to 7.75 m (gravimetric water content) as usually reported from geostatistical investigations. Future works based on dynamical system theory will advance our knowledge on spatial variability of important soil properties and the emergence of deterministic and/or stochastic components.},

In this model cortical tissue is composed of a superposition of feed-forward sub-networks (chains) each capable of transmitting packets of synchronized spikes with high reliability. Computations are then carried out by interactions of these chains. Experimental evidence for synfire chains has so far been limited to inference from detection of a few repeating spatio-temporal neuronal firing patterns in multiple single-unit recordings. Demonstration that such patterns actually come from synfire activity would require finding a meta organization among many detected patterns, as yet an untried approach. In contrast we present here a new method that directly visualizes the repetitive occurrence of synfire activity even in very large data sets of multiple single-unit recordings. We achieve reliability and sensitivity by appropriately averaging over neuron space (identities) and time. We test the method with data from a large-scale balanced recurrent network simulation containing fifty randomly activated synfire chains. The sensitivity is high enough to detect synfire chain activity in simultaneous single-unit recordings of 100 to 200 neurons from such data, enabling application to experimental data in the near future.},

Lyapunov exponent calculations, recurrence plot analyses, and standard statistical analyses of these data showed significant differences in heart behavior between the two groups of patients.

In major depression, this regular pattern is often destroyed but can be reestablished during successful treatment. The differences between healthy and abnormal sleep are generally assessed in a time-consuming process, which consists of determining the nightly variations of the sleep states (the hypnogram) based on visual inspection of the electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram, and electromyogram. In this study, three different methods of sleep EEG analysis (spectrum, outlier, and recurrence analysis) have been examined with regard to their ability to extract information about treatment effects in patients with major depression. Our data suggest that improved sleep patterns during treatment with antidepressant medication can be identified with an appropriate analysis of the EEG. By comparing different methods, we have found that many treatment effects identified by spectrum analysis can be reproduced by the much simpler technique of outlier analysis. Finally, the cyclic structure of sleep and its modification by antidepressant treatment is best illustrated by a non-linear approach, the so-called recurrence method.},

Different dimension estimates are consistent and show close similarity, thus increasing the credibility of the fractal-dimension estimates. The Lyapunov spectrum consistently shows one positive Lyapunov exponent and one zero exponent with the rest being negative, pointing to the existence of chaos. The authors then propose a least squares genetic programming (LS-GP) to reconstruct the nonlinear dynamics from the power-pool time series.

Five different orthographic data sets (20th century Italian poems, 20th century American poems, contemporary Swedish poems with their corresponding Italian translations, Italian speech samples, and American speech samples) were subjected to recurrence quantification analysis. This procedure has been found useful in the quantitative assessment of ordered series in several fields. Recurrence quantification was developed from recurrence plots as applied to the analysis of non-linear systems in the physical sciences, and is based on the computation of a distance matrix of the elements of an ordered series (in this case the letters constituting selected speech and poetic texts). The results show the possibility of demonstrating invariance between different language exemplars, despite the apparent low-level of coding (orthography). Comparison with the actual texts confirms the ability of the method to reveal recurrent structures and their complexity. Using poems as a reference standard for judging speech complexity, the technique exhibits language independence, order dependence and freedom from pure statistical characteristics of the studied sequences, as well as consistency with easily identifiable texts.

The aim was to find a structural basis for distinguishing between silent and pathological mutants. We were successful in the case of mutations on the A{\&}alpha;-chain, thanks to the peculiar features of this chain as compared to the other two. Relevant findings concerning the point mutants of the A{\&}alpha;-chain are the following: (a) the recurrence quantification analysis-based classification of such mutants is in good agreement with the clinical classification, and (b) the location of the mutated residue on the sequence plays a more relevant role than its hydrophobic features. Artificial point mutants in the terminal zone (600-866 residues) of the extended isoform of the A{\&}alpha;-chain cluster together with the natural hemorrhagic mutants of the first (1-207) residues.},

This paper presents a novel method for swallowing sound detection using hidden Markov modeling of recurrence plot features. Tracheal sound recordings of 15 healthy and nine dysphagic subjects were studied. The multidimensional state space trajectory of each signal was reconstructed using the Taken method of delays. The sequences of three recurrence plot features of the reconstructed trajectories (which have shown discriminating capability between swallowing and breath sounds) were modeled by three hidden Markov models. The Viterbi algorithm was used for swallowing sound detection. The results were validated manually by inspection of the simultaneously recorded airflow signal and spectrogram of the sounds, and also by auditory means. The experimental results suggested that the performance of the proposed method using hidden Markov modeling of recurrence plot features was superior to the previous swallowing sound detection methods.},

abstract = {Beat-to-beat R-R interval (RRV) and systolic blood pressure (SPV) variability signals were obtained from unrestrained rats in baseline and under different pharmacological treatments. The origin and extent of the nonlinearity in both signals, as well as their degree of mutual coupling, was estimated using measurements from the correlation integral (CI) and recurrence quantification analysis (RQA). After the respiratory component of baseline signals was removed, the nonlinearity was lower in the RRV and disappeared in the SPV. This also decreased the RRV-SPV coupling. The nonlinearity of RRV was also reduced after atropine, and the nonlinearity of SPV was strengthened after prazosin and N[omega]-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA). Atropine and prazosin decreased CI measures of both signals, whereas propranolol, phenylephrine, and L-NMMA decreased only those of SPV. RQA indexes of RRV increased after atropine and decreased after propranolol, whereas the reverse occurred for the RRV-SPV coupling. These results suggest that: 1) the nonlinearity of RRV appears to be very dependent on the parasympathetic activity, whereas that of SPV seems to come from its respiratory component through a nonneural pathway; 2) respiratory component appears to be involved, through the parasympathetic system, in the RRV-SPV coupling; and 3) CI and RQA measures seems to be useful in assessing autonomic mediation of RRV and RRV-SPV coupling.},

abstract = {With a rapidly growing pool of known tertiary structures, the importance of protein structure comparison parallels that of sequence alignment. We have developed a novel algorithm (DALI) for optimal pairwise alignment of protein structures. The three-dimensional co-ordinates of each protein are used to calculate residue -- residue (C{\textless}sup{\textgreater}{\&}alpha;{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} -- C{\textless}sup{\textgreater}{\&}alpha;{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) distance matrices. The distance matrices are first decomposed into elementary contact patterns, e.g. hexapeptide -- hexapeptide submatrices. Then, similar contact patterns in the two matrices are paired and combined into larger consistent sets of pairs. A Monte Carlo procedure is used to optimize a similarity score defined in terms of equivalent intramolecular distances. Several alignments are optimized in parallel, leading to simultaneous detection of the best, second-best and so on solutions. The method allows sequence gaps of any length, reversal of chain direction and free topological connectivity of aligned segments. Sequential connectivity can be imposed as an option. The method is fully automatic and identifies structural resemblances and common structural cores accurately and sensitively, even in the presence of geometrical distortions. An all-against-all alignment of over 200 representative protein structures results in an objective classification of known three-dimensional folds in agreement with visual classifications.

We herein investigated the relationships between nonlinear indexes and plasma noradrenaline concentration in conscious WKY rats and SHRs. Blood pressure was recorded for 30 min after intravenous injection of saline (0.9{\%} NaCl, 100 {\textless}i{\textgreater}{\textless}/i{\textgreater}L/kg), hexamethonium (20 mg/kg), atropine (0.5 mg/kg), atenolol (1 mg/kg) or prazosin (1 mg/kg). Spectral power in the low-frequency (LF) band and the nonlinear index ({\textless}i{\textgreater}L{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}max{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}), calculated on diastolic (DBP) and systolic blood pressures (SBP), were used to analyse the BP signal. Noradrenaline concentration was determined by radioenzymatic technique. A robust stepwise regression analysis - using noradrenaline concentration as dependent variable, and LF, {\textless}i{\textgreater}L{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}max{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} and treatment, as independent variables - shows that treatment is the main variable explaining the variance of noradrenaline level in WKY rats, excluding the use of the pooled data to explore the relationship between noradrenaline concentration and LF or {\textless}i{\textgreater}L{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}max{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}. In contrast, in SHRs, treatment has no effect on the variance of noradrenaline concentration and the pooled data were then used. In this group, no correlation was observed between noradrenaline concentration and LF. In contrast, very high positive correlation was observed between noradrenaline level and {\textless}i{\textgreater}L{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}max{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}-DBP ({\textless}i{\textgreater}r{\textless}/i{\textgreater} = 0.59; {\textless}i{\textgreater}P{\textless}/i{\textgreater} = 0.0005) or {\textless}i{\textgreater}L{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}max{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}-SBP ({\textless}i{\textgreater}r{\textless}/i{\textgreater} = 0.53; {\textless}i{\textgreater}P{\textless}/i{\textgreater} {\textless} 0.002).

Early tests for chaos led to problems when applied to financial and economic data. This motivated development of the BDS family of statistics to test for nonlinearity generally. More recently, another method of analysis has been introduced into the scientific literature. It uses a test for chaos which is relatively simple and appropriate for financial data. A quantitative version of this test is developed here and is used to analyze stock return data.},

abstract = {A data set composed of 1141 proteins representative of all eukaryotic protein sequences in the Swiss-Prot Protein Knowledge base was coded by seven physicochemical properties of amino acid residues. The resulting numerical profiles were submitted to correlation analysis after the application of a linear (simple mean) and a nonlinear (Recurrence Quantification Analysis, RQA) filter. The main RQA variables, Recurrence and Determinism, were subsequently analyzed by Principal Component Analysis. The RQA descriptors showed that (i) within protein sequences is embedded specific information neither present in the codes nor in the amino acid composition and (ii) the most sensitive code for detecting ordered recurrent (deterministic) patterns of residues in protein sequences is the Miyazawa-Jernigan hydrophobicity scale. The most deterministic proteins in terms of autocorrelation properties of primary structures were found (i) to be involved in protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions and (ii) to display a significantly higher proportion of structural disorder with respect to the average data set. A study of the scaling behavior of the average determinism with the setting parameters of RQA (embedding dimension and radius) allows for the identification of patterns of minimal length (six residues) as possible markers of zones specifically prone to inter- and intramolecular interactions.},

In order to restore or improve the lost functional movement of the body of the stroke-affected and hemiplegic subjects, a method called functional electrical stimulation (FES) has often been employed as the measure of rehabilitation. FES makes use of low levels of electrical current to activate the nerves and then the muscles, affected.

abstract = {Procedures of nonlinear parameter estimation require large samples of data. In stationary physiological situations, usually short time series are available. The method of dynamics-dependent windowing and data aggregation procedure are proposed. This technique was tested on chaotic signal generated by Lorenz model and applied to investigate beat-to-beat control of the cardiovascular system in 10 healthy volunteers. Nonivasively recorded blood pressure, respiratory activity and blood oxygen saturation were digitized and saved for further off-line analysis. The experimental procedure consisted of 10 min control--C, 20 voluntary apneas 1 min each--A, interapnea 20 periods of 1 min spontaneous breathing--B, and 10 min free-breathing recovery--R. Respiration signal served as a reference for apnea and interapnea free-breathing identification period. Correlation dimension--CD, according to Grassberger and Procaccia, and recurrence plot strategy, according to Webber and Zbilut, were applied to check dynamical properties of the signals. Results of numerical experiment on Lorenz model, original and transformed by segmentation and aggregation, support our assumption of similarity of their dynamics. Error in CD and recurrence parameters estimation strongly depended on segment length and was about 5{\%} for 600 to 1200 data points. However, even for segments of 75 to 100 samples, it did not exceed 10{\%} for all, but one, periodic testing signal. Segmentation and aggregation applied to interbeat interval (IBI) and total peripheral resistance (TPR) data showed that CD and recurrence variables estimated separately for apneic and interapneic period and those calculated for mixed (apneic and interapneic) intervals were different. Average CD and recurrence parameters of IBI and TPR for 10 subjects during apnea and interapnea intervals were significantly different than during control and recovery. The lowest CD (mean?S.D.) of 6.38?0.4, 5.62?0.2 and {\%}recurrence 10.35?0.8, 6.62?0.6 (highest ratio 4.95?0.2, 5.13?0.3) were observed in apnea for IBI and TPR, respectively. Low values of the estimates computed for mixed periods may suggest the influence of slowly varying, quasiperiodic driving force due to experimental procedure regime. Signal dynamics-dependent windowing and data aggregation regardless of the sequence of data could be a practical solution for nonlinear analysis of very short repeatable time series.},

In earlier works we had attempted to identify the inherent structural organization in proteins through a study of protein topology. We obtained a modular partitioning of protein structures with the modules correlating well with experimental evidence of early folding units or "foldons".

We observed that the use of recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) could lead to the identification of the transition state during unfolding. Additionally, our earlier contention that the modules uncovered through our graph partitioning approach correlated well with early folding units was vindicated through our simulations. Moreover, residues identified from native structure as connector hubs and which had been shown to be those that were protected during the transition phase of folding were indeed more stable (less flexible) well beyond the transition state. Further analysis of the topological pathway suggests that the all pairs shortest path in a protein is minimized during folding.{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}b{\textgreater}Conclusions{\textless}/b{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}We observed that treating a protein native structure as a network by having amino acid residues as nodes and the non-covalent interactions among them as links allows for the rationalization of many aspects of the folding process. The possibility to derive this information directly from 3D structure opens the way to the prediction of important residues in proteins, while the confirmation of the minimization of APSP for folding allows for the establishment of a potentially useful proxy for kinetic optimality in the validation of sequence-structure predictions.},

We tested the hypothesis that brain potentials evoked by the onset of a weak, low-frequency magnetic field were nonlinearly related to the stimulus. A field of 1G, 60Hz was applied for 2 s, with a 5 s inter-stimulus period, and brain potentials were recorded from occipital electrodes in eight subjects, each of whom were measured twice, with at least 1 week between measurements. The recorded signals were subjected to nonlinear (recurrence analysis) and linear (time averaging) analyses. Using recurrence analysis, magnetosensory evoked potentials (MEPs) were detected in each subject in both the initial and replicate studies, with one exception. All MEPs exhibited the expected latency but differed in dynamical characteristics, indicating that they were nonlinearly related to the stimulus. MEPs were not detected using time averaging, thereby further confirming their nonlinearity. Evolutionarily conditioned structures that help mediate linear field-transduction in lower life forms may be expressed and functionally utilized in humans, but in a role where they facilitate vulnerability to man-made environmental fields.},

We have purified paranemin from embryonic chick skeletal muscle, prepared antibodies, and demonstrated that they label at the Z-lines of both adult avian and porcine cardiac and skeletal muscle myofibrils. We determined the cDNA sequence of paranemin by immunoscreening a {\&}lambda;gt22A cDNA library from embryonic chick skeletal muscle. Northern blot analysis revealed a single transcript of 5.3 kilobases, which is much smaller than predicted from the size of paranemin (280 kDa) by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The derived amino acid sequence of paranemin (1,606 residues; 178,161 kDa) contains the conserved IF rod domain (308 amino acids), which has highest homology to the rod domains of nestin and tanabin. Thus, paranemin is an IF protein rather than an IFAP. Sequence analysis also revealed that the partial cDNA sequences of two proteins, namely EAP-300 and IFAPa-400, are almost identical to regions of the cDNA sequence of paranemin. The complete paranemin cDNA was expressed in a cell line (SW13) with, and without, detectable cytoplasmic IFs. Antibody labeling of these cells suggests that paranemin does not form IFs by itself, but rather is incorporated into heteropolymeric IFs with vimentin.},

It has been proven to be very useful in humans for both research and clinical studies concerned with cardiovascular diseases, diabetic autonomic dysfunction, hypertension and psychiatric and psychological disorders. Over the past decade, HRV has been used increasingly in animal research to analyse changes in sympathovagal balance related to diseases, psychological and environmental stressors or individual characteristics such as temperament and coping strategies. This paper discusses current and past HRV research in farm animals. First, it describes how cardiac activity is regulated and the relationships between HRV, sympathovagal balance and stress and animal welfare. Then it proceeds to outline the types of equipment and methodological approaches that have been adapted and developed to measure inter-beats intervals (IBI) and estimate HRV in farm animals. Finally, it discusses experiments and conclusions derived from the measurement of HRV in pigs, cattle, horses, sheep, goats and poultry. Emphasis has been placed on deriving recommendations for future research investigating HRV, including approaches for measuring and analysing IBI data. Data from earlier research demonstrate that HRV is a promising approach for evaluating stress and emotional states in animals. It has the potential to contribute much to our understanding and assessment of the underlying neurophysiological processes of stress responses and different welfare states in farm animals.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of heart rate variability (HRV) and its specific parameters as a new approach to assess stress load in cattle. We recorded HRV in 52 calves in three groups and in 31 cows in two groups. In calves we divided Group 1 with no obvious stress load (n=18), Group 2 with external stress load (n=17), and Group 3 with internal stress load from sickness (n=17). In cattle we divided lactating cows (n=21) and nonlactating cows (n=10). HRV parameters were analyzed in the time domain and in the frequency domain. Moreover, we applied Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) to quantify nonlinear components of HRV. In calves, linear HRV parameter decreased from Group 1 to Group 3 (PPrecurrence plot (LMAX) which is inversely related to the Lyapunov exponent. We did not find differences concerning the linear HRV parameters between the two groups in the cows. The nonlinear parameter Determinism showed significant higher values in lactating cows compared to nonlactating cows. The importance of particular HRV-parameters was tested by applying a discriminant analysis approach. In calves and cattle nonlinear parameters were most important to indicate the level of stress load on the animals. Based on the results we assume HRV to be a valuable physiological indicator for stress load in animals. Whereas linear parameters of HRV are supposed to be useful to separate qualitative different level of stress, nonlinear components of HRV distinguish quantitative different challenges for the animals.},

In the study of fast rhythms in inspiratory discharges, phrenic nerve autospectra and bilateral (left-right) phrenic coherences in 16 rats revealed two types of fast rhythm: 1) high-frequency oscillation (HFO), which had significant coherence peaks (n = 9, range 106-160 Hz, mean 132 Hz); and 2) medium-frequency oscillation (MFO), which had autospectral peaks but no distinct coherence peaks (n = 11, range 46-96 Hz, mean 66 Hz). These rhythms resembled MFOs and HFOs in the decerebrate cat, but the modal frequency range was about twice as large. In addition, these frequency values differed markedly from the 20-40 Hz of the rhythms found in earlier studies in neonatal in vitro preparations; the difference may be due to developmental immaturity.},

We define a process as creative when its time series displays these properties.

Differencing, consecutive recurrence and partial autocorrelation indicate nonrandom causation, thereby distinguishing chaos and bios from random and random walk. Embedding plots distinguish causal creative processes (e.g. bios) that include both simple and complex components of variation from stochastic processes (e.g. Brownian noise) that include only complex components, and from chaotic processes that decay from order to randomness as the number of dimensions is increased. Varying bin and dimensionality show that entropy measures symmetry and variety, and that complexity is associated with asymmetry. Trigonometric transformations measure coexisting opposites in time series and demonstrate bipolar, partial, and uncorrelated opposites in empirical processes and bios, supporting the hypothesis that bios is generated by bipolar feedback, a concept which is at variance with standard concepts of polar and complementary opposites.},

The method is based on three processes: 1) a recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) to quantify the dynamic patterns, 2) the use of mutual information (MI) and the entropy (EN) to characterize the VNDP, and 3) linear discriminant analysis to exploit the associations within MI and EN measures. Practically, the VNDP method overcomes the nonstationarity problem and exploits the nonstationary properties in HRV analyses. Physiologically, the VNDP reflects the properties of the fundamental short-term HRV dynamic system and the external associations of the system within the autonomous nervous system (ANS). The characteristic probability density peaks portrayed by VNDP plots indicate the quantum-like heart dynamics, which may provide valuable insights into the control of the ANS. The discrimination results of the reduced pattern dynamic range due to aging, from a new perspective, display the reduction in HRV. The significantly improved discriminatory power, compared to conventional RQA analyses, shows that the VNDP analysis can practically quantify the nonstationary nonlinear dynamics for ANS assessments.},

Classic surface EMG spectral variables applied to assess muscle functions are the centroid and median power spectral frequencies. More recently, nonlinear tools have been introduced to analyze the surface EMG; among them, the recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) was shown to be particularly promising for the detection of muscle status changes. The purpose of this work was to analyze the effect of motor unit short-term synchronization and conduction velocity (CV) on EMG spectral variables and two variables extracted by RQA, the percentage of recurrence ({\%}Rec) and determinism ({\%}Det). The study was performed on the basis of a simulation model, which allowed changing the degree of synchronization and mean CV of a number of motor units, and of an experimental investigation of the surface EMG signal properties detected during high-force-level isometric fatiguing contractions of the biceps brachii muscle. Simulations and experimental results were largely in agreement and show that 1) spectral variables, {\%}Rec, and {\%}Det are influenced by CV and degree of synchronization; 2) spectral variables are highly correlated with {\%}Det (R = [-]0.95 in the simulations and[-] 0.78 and[-] 0.75 for the initial values and normalized slopes, respectively, in the experimental signals), and thus the information they provide on muscle properties is basically the same; and 3) variations of {\%}Det and {\%}Rec in response to changes in muscle properties are significantly larger than the variations of spectral variables. This study validates RQA as a means for fatigue assessment with potential advantages (such as the higher sensitivity to changes of muscle status) with respect to the classic spectral analysis.},

Recently, a CVR pattern particular to chronic fatigue syndrome has been observed. In the present study, we aimed to develop methodologies for assessing disease-specific CVR patterns. As a prototype, a population of 50 consecutive patients with FMF (familial Mediterranean fever) was studied and compared with control populations. A 10 min supine/30 min head-up tilt test with recording of the heart rate and blood pressure or the pulse transit time was performed. Five studies were conducted applying different methods. In each study, statistical analysis identified independent predictors of CVR in FMF. Based on regression coefficients of these predictors, a linear DS (discriminant score) was computed for every subject. Each study established an equation to assess CVR, calculate DS for FMF and determine the sensitivity and specificity of the DS cut-off. In each of the five studies, abnormal CVR was observed in FMF patients. The best accuracy (88{\%} sensitivity and 90.1 {\%} specificity for FMF) was obtained by a method based on beat-to-beat heart rate and pulse transit time recordings. Data was processed by fractal and recurrence quantitative analysis with recordings in FMF patients compared with a mixed control population. Identification of disease-specific CVR patterns was possible with the methodologies described in the present study. In FMF, disease-specific CVR may be explained by the interplay between neuroendocrine loops specific to FMF with cardiovascular homoeostatic mechanisms. Recognition of disease-specific CVR patterns may advance the understanding of homoeostatic mechanisms and have implications in clinical practice.},

We found interesting evidence of chaotic behaviour as maximal Lyapunov exponents were positive for all time series considered. These results were consistent with those computed from corresponding surrogate time series. Positive Lyapunov exponents allow an estimation of the lead time of correlation for making reliable predictions.},

abstract = {We develop a theory for the formation of loops and intrachain contacts in polymer molecules which are subject to excluded volume. We use two methods: (i) exhaustive simulations of chain conformations on two-dimensional square lattices, and (ii) the Edwards path integral approach. The predictions are compared to those of the Jacobson-Stockmayer theory, which neglects excluded volume. Our results show that the cyclization probability in two dimensions depends on loop length to a power between -1.6 to -2.4, in contrast to the prediction of Jacobson-Stockmayer of a power of -1. In addition, the cyclization probability depends on the position in the chain, and end effects are significant. A principal result of the present work is the development of "topological" correlation functions among multiple loops in a chain. If two loops are far apart along the chain, they act independently, but as they approach each other, or if they are interlinked, then one can strongly hinder or enhance the likelihood of another. For these situations, the path integral theory is an improvement over Jacobson-Stockmayer, but misses some important features of short-ranged packing effects. A particularly striking conclusion is that in the presence of the most probable first loop, the formation of a second contact is strongly preferred to be in either of only two possible conformations: a helix or an antiparallel sheet. This suggests that the basis for secondary structure formation in globular proteins may be packing and conformational freedom, rather than hydrogen bonding or other specific interactions.},

There is increasing evidence that dysautonomia occurs in CFS manifest primarily as disordered regulation of cardiovascular responses to stress. We impart our experience relating to diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of CFS based on identification and management of dysautonomia. Recently proposed methods for assessment of the cardiovascular reactivity, the 'hemodynamic instability score' (HIS) and the 'Fractal and Recurrence Analysis-based Score' (FRAS), served for this purpose. On HUTT, a particular dysautonomia is revealed in CFS patients that differ from dysautonomia in several other disorders. This distinct abnormality in CFS can be identified by HIS {\textgreater} -0.98 (sensitivity 84.5{\%} and specificity 85.1{\%}) and FRAS {\textgreater} +0.22 (sensitivity 70{\%} and specificity 88{\%}). Therefore, the HIS and FRAS may be used, in the appropriate clinical context, to support the diagnosis of CFS, which until now, could only be subjectively inferred. A pilot study suggested that midodrine treatment, directed at the autonomic nervous system in CFS, results first in correction of dysautonomia followed by improvement of fatigue. This finding implies that dysautonomia is pivotal in the pathophysiology CFS, at least in a large part of the patients, and that manipulating the autonomic nervous system may be effective in the treatment of CFS.},

The character of their frequency distributions at 237, 327, 408 and 610 MHz in both L- and R-handed circular polarizations is studied. While for the complete time intervals no simple distributions of spikes (either exponential or power-law) are recognized, for shorter intervals both exponential and power-law distributions are observed. No significant difference is found in the distributions for L- and R-polarized data. Further analysis reveals that spikes appearing in dense groups and with high intensities preferentially have exponential distributions, while the sparse spikes with lower intensities are rather characterized by power-law distribution functions with high exponents. Groups of independent spikes (cases with low rates and low intensities) have power-law distributions trend in agreement with the coherent spike mechanisms. Tests are provided regarding statistical analyses. The nonlinear analysis reveals that the degree of complexity of the system varies. It decreases when the attractor dimensions and the Lyapunov exponents assume smaller values, which happens when very strong spikes are present. The changing characteristics of the statistical parameters are probably the result of a mutual interaction in the source environment or a product of propagation conditions.},

The proposed method has two major steps: an optimal choice of wavelet decomposition scales and an estimation of the wavelet coefficients; the former is determined by the noise residual ratio based on dual-wavelet, whereas the latter is analyzed combining with the singular spectrum analysis and the spatial correlation theory. The chaotic signals generated by Lorenz model as well as the observed monthly series of sunspots are, respectively, applied for simulation analysis, the experimental results show that the performance of the proposed method is superior to that of other methods.},

These reports, as well as those involving effects on brain activity observed after a fixed time of exposure, are critically reviewed here. A consistent stimulus-response relationship between EMFs and changes in brain activity has been demonstrated in animal and human subjects. The effects, which consisted of onset and offset evoked potentials, were observed under conditions permitting the inference that the fields were transduced like ordinary stimuli such as light and sound. However, unlike the changes in brain activity induced by these stimuli, the changes induced by EMFs were governed by nonlinear laws. The studies involving attempts to determine whether a period of EMF exposure caused a metabolic effect reflected in pre-exposure/post-exposure differences in brain activity were generally inconclusive.},

These alterations in the sensory environment lead to observed changes in the temporal structure of the center of pressure (COP) trajectories. COP path length increased across gain settings while COP coefficient of variation decreased. The COP became increasingly more deterministic across more challenging sensory organization test (SOT) conditions and with increasing gain, and more nonstationary across more challenging SOT conditions and when the support surface was sway-referenced using a 1.8 gain setting. These findings indicate that changes in the responsiveness of the support surface and/or visual surround within each of the sway-referenced SOT conditions had functional consequences for the control of posture as evidenced by the variations in postural sway dynamics.},

abstract = {A mesocosm experiment was performed in order to observe the behaviour of an aquatic community under stable external conditions. The hypothesis was that the community would show temporal fluctuations that correspond to the principles of deterministic chaos. Water from a brackish (9 psu) location was kept from 31 March 1989 to 11 July 1990 in a 100 l mesocosm under artificial laboratory conditions to develop a species-depleted climax community of plankton. The mesocosm was reared for a further period of 1764 d (12 July 1990 to 11 May 1995) under controlled light and temperature conditions and sampled in short intervals of 3 to 4 d. During the period of observations there were no changes in species composition, but strong fluctuation in biomass occurred. The biomass data for picophytoplankton, nanophytoplankton, copepods and rotifers were used to check the systems dynamics for chaotic behaviour by recurrence quantification analysis (RQA), a new method which is applied here to analyse non-linear dynamics in marine ecosystems for the first time. Recurrence histograms show a single period of 7 wk of picophytoplankton, a broad range of periods for nanophytoplankton between 4 and 7 wk with isolated peaks at 5 and 7 wk, a broad range of periods for copepods with a peak at 5 wk and 2 minor peaks at 3 and 12.5 wk, and transient behaviour in rotifers with peaks at 5.5 and 11.5 wk, with non-linear interaction between selected bands of periods. A comparison with shuffled time series shows that the system dynamic is deterministic with transients and that a non-stationary trend exists in the phytoplankton time series. No chaotic behaviour could be detected.},

In the two plasmodial species, amino acid frequencies do not correlate with properties such as hydrophilicity, small volume, or flexibility, which might be expected to characterize residues involved in nonglobular domains but do correlate with A-richness in codons.

The success of five commonly used schemes for estimating interplanetary propagation times is examined. Propagation assuming a fixed plane normal at 45 degrees to the GSE x-axis (i.e. the Parker Spiral estimate) is found to give optimal mutual information. The mutual information depends on the point in space chosen as the target for the propagation estimate, and we find that it is maximized by choosing a point in the nightside rather than dayside magnetosphere. In addition, we employ recurrence plot analysis to visualize contributions to the mutual information, this suggests that it appears on timescales of hours rather than minutes.},

The present study combines a nonlinear modeling technique with the CPR index to recover the synchronization diagram of non-phase-coherent oscillators. Lyapunov exponents are also utilized to locate the onset point of synchronization. This allows the prediction of the regime of phase synchronization as well as non-synchronization in a broad parameter space of coupling strength without further experiments.

abstract = {The deterministic chaotic behaviour of magnetosphere was analyzed, using AE index time series. The significant chaotic quantifiers like, Lyapunov exponent, spatio-temporal entropy and nonlinear prediction error for AE index time series under various physical conditions were estimated and compared. During high solar activity (1991), the values of Lyapunov exponent for AE index time series representing quiet conditions (yearly mean Combining double low line 0.5{\&}plusmn;0.1 min{\textless}sup{\textgreater}{\&}minus;1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) have no significant difference from those values for corresponding storm conditions (yearly mean Combining double low line 0.5{\&}plusmn;0.17 min{\textless}sup{\textgreater}{\&}minus;1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}). This implies that, for the cases considered here, geomagnetic storms may not be an additional source to increase or decrease the deterministic chaotic aspects of magnetosphere, especially during high solar activity. During solar minimum period (1994), the seasonal mean value of Lyapunov exponent for AE index time series belong to quiet periods in winter (0.7{\&}plusmn;0.11 min{\textless}sup{\textgreater}{\&}minus;1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) is higher compared to corresponding value of storm periods in winter (0.36{\&}plusmn;0.09 min{\textless}sup{\textgreater}{\&}minus;1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}). This may be due to the fact that, stochastic part, which is {\textless}I{\textgreater}Dst{\textless}/I{\textgreater} dependent could be more prominent during storms, thereby increasing fluctuations/stochasticity and reducing determinism in AE index time series during storms. It is observed that, during low solar active period (1994), the seasonal mean value of entropy for time series representing storm periods of equinox is greater than that for quiet periods. However, significant difference is not observed between storm and quiet time values of entropy during high solar activity (1991), which is also true for nonlinear prediction error for both low and high solar activities. In the case of both high and low solar activities, the higher standard deviations of yearly mean Lyapunov exponent values for AE index time series for storm periods compared to those for quiet periods might be due to the strong interplay between stochasticity and determinism during storms. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} It is inferred that, the external driving forces, mainly due to solar wind, make the solar-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling more complex, which generates many active degrees of freedom with various levels of coupling among them, under various physical conditions.

abstract = {In the presence of ATP, kinesin proceeds along the protofilament of microtubule by alternated binding of two motor domains on the tubulin binding sites. Because the processivity of kinesin is much higher than other motor proteins, it has been speculated that there exists a mechanism for allosteric regulation between the two monomers. Recent experiments suggest that ATP binding to the leading head (L) domain in kinesin is regulated by the rearward strain built on the neck-linker. We test this hypothesis by explicitly modeling a C{\&}alpha;-based kinesin structure whose motor domains are bound on the tubulin binding sites. The equilibrium structures of kinesin on the microtubule show disordered and ordered neck-linker configurations for the L and trailing head, respectively. The comparison of the structures between the two heads shows that several native contacts present at the nucleotide binding site in the L are less intact than those in the binding site of the rear head. The network of native contacts obtained from this comparison provides the internal tension propagation pathway, which leads to the disruption of the nucleotide binding site in the L. Also, using an argument based on polymer theory, we estimate the internal tension built on the neck-linker to be {\textless}i{\textgreater}f{\textless}/i{\textgreater} {\&}asymp; 12-15 pN. Both of these conclusions support the experimental hypothesis.},

abstract = {An important goal for characterization of texture appearance is the quantification of spatial patterns. The objective was to investigate the potential usefulness of two fractal metrics based on fast Fourier transform and gliding box lacunarity as descriptors of visual texture in ham slices. Images were acquired from three qualities of sliced pork ham, typically consumed in Ireland (200 slices/quality). Unexpected characteristics in textural pattern were revealed; the values of fractal dimension were larger for the smoothest surface. Alternatively, the decreasing trend of the power spectrum intercept towards the smoother premium quality ham showed that it correlates well with the overall magnitude of visual roughness. The results of lacunarity suggest that it has a discriminating power among the three ham qualities and its behaviour resembles the one of an exponential decay function. Results showed that Fourier analysis dimension, power spectrum intercept and lacunarity are important fractal parameters and useful quantitative descriptors that capture information embedded in the spatial structure of the underlying image texture of hams.},

abstract = {Evidence suggests that dab and rainbow trout are able to quickly adjust their food intake to an appropriate level when offered novel diets. In addition day-to-day and meal-to-meal food intake varies greatly and meal timing is plastic. Why this is the case is not clear: Food intake in fish is influenced by many factors, however the hierarchy and mechanisms by which these interact is not yet fully understood. A model of food intake may be helpful to understand these phenomena; to determine model type it is necessary to understand the qualitative nature of food intake. Food intake can be regarded as an autoregressive (AR) time series, as the amount of food eaten at time t will be influenced by previous meals, and this allows food intake to be considered using time series analyses. Here, time series data were analysed using nonlinear techniques to obtain qualitative information from which evidence for the hierarchy of mechanisms controlling food intake may be drawn. Time series were obtained for a group of dab and individuals and a group of rainbow trout for analysis. Surrogate data sets were generated to test several null hypotheses describing linear processes and all proved significantly different to the real data, suggesting nonlinear dynamics. Examination of topography and recurrence diagrams suggested that all series were deterministic and non-stationary. The point correlation dimension (PD2i) suggested low-dimensional dynamics. Our findings suggest therefore that any model of appetite should create output that is deterministic, non-stationary, low-dimensional and having nonlinear dynamics.},

abstract = {Nonlinear dynamics theory has been a tool of choice in the analysis of physiological signals and systems. This paper presents a novel approach in the analysis of tracheal swallowing and breath sounds based on nonlinear dynamics theory. As the tracheal sound signal is nonstationary, the signal was studied based on the recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) method, which is a useful technique in the analysis of nonstationary and noisy signals. Tracheal sound recordings of 15 healthy and 9 dysphagic subjects were studied. The multidimensional state space trajectory of each signal was reconstructed using Taken$\backslash$u2019s method of delays. The reconstructed trajectories were analyzed by the RQA technique. The preliminary results suggested that some recurrence parameters were appreciably different between swallowing and breath sounds. In order to confirm discriminating ability of the parameters, an automated method for extraction of swallowing sounds in the records of the tracheal swallowing and breath sounds was investigated. The swallowing sound extraction results were validated by manual inspection of the simultaneously recorded airflow signal and spectrogram of the sounds and also by auditory means. Experimental results proved that the investigated method more accurately detected the boundaries of swallowing sounds than methods proposed previously. Swallowing sound detection may be employed in a system for automated swallowing assessment and diagnosis of swallowing disorders (dysphagia) by acoustical means.},

Since spectral analysis by fast Fourier transform (FFT) constitutes a linear transformation of the data, the present study was designed to reevaluate the time-course of muscle fatigue with a nonlinear tool, recurrence quantification analysis (RQA). Surface EMG recordings were obtained from the multifidus muscle of 17 human subjects during isometric posture-holding of the upper torso. The process of muscle fatigue was found to be linear for 59{\%} of the subjects by FFT criteria, but nonlinear for 76{\%} by RQA criteria. As a demonstrative control, both slow and fast transients occurring within a nonlinear mathematical process could be accurately depicted by RQA, but not by FFT. It is concluded that assessment of EMG patterns by nonlinear techniques can give insight into the time-course of fatiguing muscles attributed to the summation of several nonlinear and competing processes.},

We describe a method for detecting a stimulus-related change in brain electrical activity that persists while the stimulus is present (presence effect).

Any form of law-governed dynamical activity induced in the EEG can be detected, particularly activity that is nonlinearly related to the stimulus.

abstract = {Objective: Testing the hypothesis that alterations in non-linear dynamics of the cardiovascular variability appear in healthy, awake subjects during voluntary apnea. Subjects and Methods: Ten young subjects performed 20 apneas 60 s each separated by 1 min free breathing. Inter-beat interval (IBI) measured as RR-interval in ECG, systolic (SYS) and diastolic (DIAS) arterial blood pressure, stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO) and total peripheral resistance (TPR) were non-invasively recorded and computed by Portapress 2 system. Correlation dimension according to Grassberger-Proccacia algorithm (CD) and ratio of {\%} determinism versus {\%} recurrence (RDR) computed from recurrence plot according to Webber and Zbiluth [J. Appl. Physiol. 76 (1994) 965] were used as the indices of chaos and complexity. Sequential time series of cardiovascular variables in consecutive 60-s apneas and inter-apnea free breathings were separately windowed and aggregated. CD and RDR of aggregated apneic time series were compared with CD and RDR values of aggregated time series of inter-apnea free breathing, 10 min at rest and 10 min recovery. Reliability of the aggregation method of sequential time series was tested on transformed simulated data generated by Lorenz model. Error in CD and RDR estimation did not exceed 5{\%} and 1{\%}, respectively. Results: CD of cardiovascular variables computed from aggregated apneas was significantly reduced and RDR augmented versus control and recovery periods. CD and RDR values of inter-apnea phases were in between those in control and during apneas. Time domain linear variance (SD) was increased during aggregated apneas. Conclusions: Signal dynamics dependent windowing and data aggregation could be a useful tool for non-linear analysis of short repeatable sequential time series; time domain linear variability of the cardiovascular dynamics is augmented while complexity reduced during apneic chemoreceptor stimulation; alterations in non-linear dynamics of cardiovascular variables during apneas in healthy normotensive subjects may suggest an early sign of a mechanism implicated in arterial hypertension in OSAS.},

Established linear and non-linear parameters of heart rate variability (HRV) were calculated minute-by-minute in 44 young patients with an NCS history (age 7-20 years, 22 female, 22 male, positive HUTT) and 34 age-matched healthy controls (age 7-20 years, 17 female, 17 male, negative HUTT) during 60� HUTT. The influence of age and gender on the response to tilting was studied using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. We also assessed the predictive power of individual features with respect to HUTT outcome within three temporal windows (0-2 min after tilt; 2-5 min after tilt, and 5-32 min before tilt-back) by means of receiver operating characteristics analysis. Our results indicate that prediction of HUTT outcome should be restricted to subjects in or after puberty. In this group, descriptors based on co-occurrence or joint-recurrence analysis in recurrence plots showed promising predictive power (up to 86{\%} sensitivity and 90{\%} specificity, area under the curve 0.91). Time-domain parameters (standard deviation of differences for successive RR intervals) reached 75{\%} sensitivity and 80{\%} specificity. We conclude that HRV analysis within the first 5 min after tilting provides significant information on HUTT outcome and may be useful in conjunction with more sophisticated classification strategies for shortening HUTT duration in subjects after puberty.},

Linear techniques (e.g. Fourier transform) have been used to analyse spontaneous synaptic events in previous studies, but such methods are inappropriate if the timing pattern is complex. We have investigated spontaneous glycinergic miniature synaptic currents (mIPSCs) in principal cells of the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body. The random versus deterministic (or periodic) nature of mIPSCs was assessed using recurrence quantification analysis. Nonlinear methods were then used to quantify any detected determinism in spontaneous release, and to test for chaotic or fractal patterns. Modelling demonstrated that this procedure is much more sensitive in detecting periodicities than conventional techniques. mIPSCs were found to exhibit periodicities that were abolished by blockade of internal calcium stores with ryanodine, suggesting calcium oscillations in the presynaptic inhibitory terminals. Analysis indicated that mIPSC occurrences were chaotic in nature. Furthermore, periodicities were less evident in congenitally deaf mice than in normal mice, indicating that appropriate neural activity during development is necessary for the expression of deterministic chaos in mIPSC patterns. We suggest that chaotic oscillations of mIPSC occurrences play a physiological role in signal processing in the auditory brainstem.{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}b{\textgreater}Note:{\textless}/b{\textgreater} The authors cite a {\textless}a href="http://www.recurrence-plot.tk/plagiarism"{\textgreater}plagiarism{\textless}/a{\textgreater} of the PhD thesis "{\textless}a href="http://www.recurrence-plot.tk/furtherreading.php"{\textgreater}Encounters with neighbours{\textless}/a{\textgreater}".},

For both time series, the Schwabe cycle is the only period of statistical significance, whose mean value is 10.61 yr. The length of the Schwabe cycle for the smoothed monthly mean sunspot areas in the northern hemisphere actually differs from that in the southern hemisphere, which should lead to phase asynchrony between the two series. Both the cross-wavelet transform and wavelet coherence analyses show an asynchronous behavior with phase mixing in the high-frequency components of hemispheric sunspot activity and a strong synchronous behavior with coherent phase angles in the low-frequency components corresponding to period scales around the Schwabe cycle. Although a phase coherence is found at timescales of about 8.5-13.5 yr (which is similar to those of Donner {\&} Thiel, but within a shorter period), phases are not always coherent at the timescales in the considered time interval. The availability of a physical, meaningful phase definition depends crucially on the appropriate choice of reference frequencies. At the coherent period scales, the leading role is found from those conditions where processes of sunspot formation in the northern hemisphere occur earlier than in the southern one (except some exceptions in several years around the year 1900) during the years of about 1874-1926 to those where the opposite is true during the years of about 1926-1966, and returning back again during the years of about 1966-2008.

This phenomenology has been posed as a possible factor influencing prion folding. To test this conjecture, recurrence quantification analysis was applied to two model 36mers, and the Syrian hamster prion protein. A unique divergence of the radius function for the recurrence quantification variable {\%}DET of hydrophobicity patterns was observed for both 36mers, and in a critical region of the hamster prion protein. This divergence suggests a partition between strong short- and long-range hydrophobicity patterns, and may be an important factor in prion phenomenology, along with other global thermodynamic factors.},

Before treatment, lmax index of blood pressure was lower (P {\textless} 0.01) in the SHRs than in the Wistar-Kyoto rats. Clonidine significantly increased lmax (P {\textless} 0.01) to the level observed in normotensive rats, at 24 h and up to 4 wk after infusion. We conclude that clonidine has a significant chronic effect on blood pressure dynamics, as evidenced by nonlinear methods.

Based on an analysis of biomass time series for each species, we show that two measures computed from the joint recurrence matrix, the Kolmogorov entropy and percent determinism, capture aspects of community stability that are not detected using the coefficient of variation for the whole community. In particular, when population fluctuations are correlated in time, recurrence analysis is a superior method for detecting the stabilizing effect of species richness on a community.

As these two classes of movements are tightly interlinked in everyday behavior, a common theoretical foundation spanning across these two types of movements would be valuable. Furthermore, it has been argued that these two movement types may constitute primitives for more complex behavior. The goal of this paper is to develop a rigorous taxonomic foundation that not only permits better communication between different research communities, but also helps in defining movement types in experimental design and thereby clarifies fundamental questions about primitives in motor control. We propose formal definitions for discrete and rhythmic movements, analyze some of their variants, and discuss the application of a smoothness measure to both types that enables quantification of discreteness and rhythmicity. Central to the definition of discrete movement is their separation by postures. Based on this intuitive definition, certain variants of rhythmic movement are indistinguishable from a sequence of discrete movements, reflecting an ongoing debate in the motor neuroscience literature. Conversely, there exist rhythmic movements that cannot be composed of a sequence of discrete movements. As such, this taxonomy may provide a language for studying more complex behaviors in a principled fashion.},

Therefore, a relevant feature of the method is that it finally may be applied also in cases of non linear and non stationary time series analysis. In addition, the method enables also to analyze the fractal variance function, the Generalized Fractal Dimension and, finally, the relative probability density function of the data.

The choice of the region for first return is dictated by the symbolic dynamics (e.g., kneading sequence) of the relevant trajectories. The renormalization group can be formulated on the symbolic level, but once translated to maps it yields the said renormalization scheme. We show how the well-studied examples of the onset of chaos via period doubling and quasiperiodicity fit into this approach, and argue that these problems get in fact unified. The unification leads also to a generalization that allows us to study the onset of chaos in maps that belong to larger spaces of functions than those usually considered. In these maps we discover a host of new scenarios for the onset of chaos. These scenarios are physically relevant since the maps considered are reductions of simple flows. We present a theoretical analysis of some of these new scenarios, and report universal results. Finally we show that all the available renormalization groups can be found using symbolic manipulations only.},

The present study was designed to examine the impact of changing shoulder joint position on the relation between surface EMG amplitude and isometric force production of the abductor digiti minimi muscle (ADM). EMG{\&}ndash;force relation of ADM was examined in two shoulder positions: 30? adduction (ANT) and 30? abduction (POST) on the horizontal plane, i.e. under higher and lower force-generating capacity, respectively. The relation was studied over the full range isometric force (10{\&}ndash;100{\%} of maximum force in 10{\%} increments, 3 s duration) by analysing root mean square (RMS), median frequency (Mf) of the power spectrum and non-linear recurrence quantification analysis (percentage of determinism: {\%}DET) of the surface EMG signals. We found that in POST, the slope of the RMS{\&}ndash;force relation was significantly higher than in ANT, while its general shape (strictly linear) was preserved. Averaged Mf of the EMG power spectrum was significantly higher in POST that in ANT, while no difference in {\%}DET was observed between the two shoulder positions. The higher slope of the EMG{\&}ndash;force relation in POST than in ANT is interpreted in terms of increased gain of the excitatory drive-firing rate relation. It is concluded that discharge from sensory receptors signalling shoulder position may act to regulate the gain of the excitatory drive-firing rate relation of motoneurones in order to compensate for reduced recruitment efficiency.},

Capturing and quantifying this nonlinear behaviour is crucial at all levels of description, ranging from individual events to global phenomenology. In recent years, a range of techniques derived from complex systems science has been applied successfully to nonlinear plasma datasets. The present paper reviews several of these techniques in the context of applications spanning fusion, space, solar and astrophysical plasmas. Topics include non-Gaussian probability density functions, notably extreme event distributions in fusion and astrophysics and power law distributions in the solar context; differencing and rescaling of fluctuation data, which has yielded information on the number of dominant plasma turbulent processes, and the spatiotemporal ranges over which they operate, in plasmas ranging from microquasar accretion discs to L-mode and dithering H-mode fusion plasmas in the MAST tokamak; quantitative measures of mutual information content and pattern repetition between causally linked but spatiotemporally separated nonlinear events in solar wind and magnetospheric plasmas; global statistics of full-disc solar irradiance; and ELMing, considered as a sequence of pulsed events, in H-mode fusion plasmas in the JET tokamak. These developments in nonlinear plasma data characterization provide fresh additional insights into the underlying plasma physics.

abstract = {Triggering and synchronization are encountered in many geophysical phenomena, including geodynamics. Both these effects are generated by the action of additional forcing, which is much smaller than the main driving force. That means that triggering and synchronization are connected with nonlinear interactions of objects, in this case with initiation of instability in systems that are close to the critical state. In seismic process the main component is the tectonic stress and the additional forcing is exerted by various external impacts like tides, reservoir exploitation, big explosions, magnetic storms, etc.{\textless}br{\textless}br{\textgreater}In the paper, the results of laboratory and field experiments on the electromagnetic (EM) initiation and synchronization of mechanical instability (slip) are presented. Slip events were recorded as acoustic emission bursts. In the first series of experiments strong EM pulses were applied to the mechanical system driven close to the critical state, namely, to the (dry) rock samples placed on an inclined supporting sample at the slope angle less than, but close to the critical slip angle. It has been found that EM impact initiates slip with probability {\textless}i{\textgreater}P{\textless}/i{\textgreater} {\&}asymp; 0.07 at the voltage {\&}Delta;{\textless}i{\textgreater}V{\textless}/i{\textgreater} = 1.3 kV and with probability {\textless}i{\textgreater}P{\textless}/i{\textgreater} {\&}asymp; 0.2 at {\&}Delta;{\textless}i{\textgreater}V{\textless}/i{\textgreater} {\&}asymp; 10 kV if the EM field is applied parallel to the slip surface (first mode). On the other hand, the application of EM pulse hampers the slip considerably if the EM field is directed perpendicularly to the slip surface (second mode): the slip was not observed even at the angle that was larger than the critical one.{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}In the second series of experiments the periodic EM and mechanical forcing were applied to the standard slider-spring system.

Combined impact of periodic and constant voltages invokes transition from double frequency synchronization to 1:1 synchronization if the direct component of voltage is larger than the periodic one. Synchronization affects not only waiting times, but also frequency-energy distribution: i. the energy of bursts emitted in synchronized mode have much less scatter than in the absence of the periodic forcing, ii. the sudden decrease of synchronizing forcing is followed by acoustic burst of much larger energy than during forcing.{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}The elementary theory of EM triggering and synchronization is given: the effects are explained by the action of EM ponderomotive (electrostriction) forces, which modify Coulomb stress similar to the well known pore pressure model.

However, when nonlinear determinism was simulated by adding either random-phase sine or Lorenz signals, the added signals were detected only by RA. Auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) were studied in five subjects using RA. We detected not only the characteristic linear effects caused by onset and offset of the sound, but also nonlinear AEPs not previously reported; they occurred at 473--661 ms after onset, and 282--602 ms after offset, depending on the subject. In five other subjects we found nonlinear magnetosensory evoked potentials; they occurred at 209--354 ms after field onset, depending on the subject.

In an attempt to address this issue, we utilized a short postural challenge, recorded beat-to-beat heart rate (HR) and pulse transit time (PTT), assessed the data by fractal and recurrence quantification analysis, and processed the obtained variables by multivariate statistics. A 10-min supine phase of the head-up tilt test was followed by recording 600 cardiac cycles on tilt, that is, 5-10 min. Three groups of patients were studied, each including 20 subjects matched for age and gender? healthy subjects, patients with essential hypertension (HT), and patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). The latter group was studied on account of the well-known dysautonomia of CFS patients, which served as contrast against the cardiovascular reactivity of the healthy population. A total of 52 variables of the HR and PTT were determined in each subject. The multivariate model identified the best predictors for the assessment of reactivity of healthy subjects vs CFS. Based on these predictors, the 'Fractal {\&} Recurrence Analysis-based Score' (FRAS) was calculated: FRAS=76.2+0.04*HR-supine-DET -12.9*HR-tilt-R/L -0.31*HR-tilt-s.d. -19.27*PTT-tilt-R/L -9.42*PTT-tilt-WAVE. The median values and IQR of FRAS in the groups were: healthy=-1.85 (IQR 1.89), hypertensives=+0.52 (IQR 5.78), and CFS=-24.2 (5.34) (HT vs healthy subjects: P=0.0036; HT vs CFS: P{\textless}0.0001).

abstract = {This work deals with the connection between two basic phenomena in Nonlinear Dynamics: synchronization of chaotic systems and recurrences in phase space. Synchronization takes place when two or more systems adapt (synchronize) some characteristic of their respective motions, due to an interaction between the systems or to a common external forcing. The appearence of synchronized dynamics in chaotic systems is rather universal but not trivial. In some sense, the possibility that two chaotic systems synchronize is counterintuitive: chaotic systems are characterized by the sensitivity ti different initial conditions. Hence, two identical chaotic systems starting at two slightly different initial conditions evolve in a different manner, and after a certain time, they become uncorrelated. Therefore, at a first glance, it does not seem to be plausible that two chaotic systems are able to synchronize. But as we will see later, synchronization of chaotic systems has been demonstrated.{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}On one hand it is important to investigate the conditions under which synchronization of chaotic systems occurs, and on the other hand, to develop tests for the detection of synchronization. In this work, I have concentrated on the second task for the cases of phase synchronization (PS) and generalized synchronization (GS). Several measures have been proposed so far for the detection of PS and GS. However, difficulties arise with the detection of synchronization in systems subjected to rather large amounts of noise and/or instationarities, which are common when analyzing experimental data. The new measures proposed in the course of this thesis are rather robust with respect to these effects. They hence allow to be applied to data, which have evaded synchronization analysis so far. The proposed tests for synchronization in this work are based on the fundamental property of recurrences in phase space.},

While several linear approaches are often insufficient to describe such processes, there are several nonlinear methods that, however, require rather long time observations. To overcome these difficulties, we propose measures of complexity based on vertical structures in recurrence plots and apply them to the logistic map as well as to heart-rate-variability data. For the logistic map these measures enable us not only to detect transitions between chaotic and periodic states, but also to identify laminar states, i.e., chaos-chaos transitions. The traditional recurrence quantification analysis fails to detect the latter transitions. Applying our measures to the heart-rate-variability data, we are able to detect and quantify the laminar phases before a life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia occurs thereby facilitating a prediction of such an event. Our findings could be of importance for the therapy of malignant cardiac arrhythmias.},

time series from complex systems. Starting from the concept of recurrences in

adjacency matrix of an associated complex network which links different points
in time if the evolution of the considered states is very similar. A critical
comparison of these recurrence networks with similar existing techniques is
presented, revealing strong conceptual benefits of the new approach which can
be considered as a unifying framework for transforming time series into complex
networks that also includes other methods as special cases.
It is demonstrated that there are fundamental relationships between the
topological properties of recurrence networks and the statistical properties of
the phase space density of the underlying dynamical system. Hence, the network
description yields new quantitative characteristics of the dynamical complexity
of a time series, which substantially complement existing measures of
recurrence quantification analysis.},

abstract = {The recurrence of states is a fundamental behaviour of dynamical systems. As a modern technique of nonlinear data analysis, the recurrence plot visualises and analyses the recurrence structure. Its quantification (recurrence quantification analysis, RQA) allows us to detect transitions in the system's dynamics. In the last decade, RPs and RQA have become popular in many scientific fields. However, a sufficient significance test was not yet developed. We propose a statistical test for the RQA which is based on bootstrapping of the characteristic small scale structures in the recurrence plot. Using this test we can present confidence bounds for the detected transitions and, hence, get a more reliable result. We demonstrate the new technique on marine dust records from the Atlantic which were used to infer climate changes in Africa for the last 4 millennia.},

Transient phases of maximal height and tree number are investigated by means of recurrence quantification analysis (RQA). Simulations are compared with model runs where evolution is excluded. The causes behind phenotype changes in terms of strategy parameters of trees can be identified with the help of RQA, while linear methods alone give ambiguous results.

The borehole was drilled in 1993 and has been in equilibrium since then. The data obtained reveal that: (1) the temperature-time series showed a complex, apparently random oscillation pattern with amplitudes of up to 25 mK; (2) irregular temperature variations characterized by larger oscillations may alternate with relatively "quiet" intervals; and (3) the character of the oscillation may vary both in depth as well as in time and the transition between two distinct regimes may be sudden.{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}The Fourier analysis detected "red noise" behavior of the signal but did not highlight any specific peak(s) corresponding to periodicity in the measured temperature series.

Parameters of the time-delay reconstruction of the attractor are investigated, including the number of data points, the time delay, the window duration, and the duration of the signal being analyzed. Adequate values are recommended. Digital low-pass filtering causes the dimension to increase as the filter cutoff frequency decreases, in accord with a previously published prediction. The stationarity of the correlation dimension is examined; the dimension appears to decrease over the course of 120 s of continuous stimulation. Implications for the reliable estimation of the dimension are considered. Several surrogate data sets are constructed, based on both early (0-30 s) and late (100-130 s) OKN segments. Most of the surrogate data sets randomize some aspect of the original OKN, while maintaining other aspects. Dimensions are found for all surrogates and for the original OKN. Evidence is found that is consistent with some amount of deterministic and nonlinear dynamics in OKN. When this structure is randomized in the surrogate, the dimension changes or the dimension algorithm ceases to converge to a finite value. Implications for further analysis and modeling of OKN are discussed.},

The presence of splogs degrades blog search results as well as wastes network resources. In our approach we exploit unique blog temporal dynamics to detect splogs. There are three key ideas in our splog detection framework. We first represent the blog temporal dynamics using self-similarity matrices defined on the histogram intersection similarity measure of the time, content, and link attributes of posts. Second, we show via a novel visualization that the blog temporal characteristics reveal attribute correlation, depending on type of the blog (normal blogs and splogs). Third, we propose the use of temporal structural properties computed from self-similarity matrices across different attributes. In a splog detector, these novel features are combined with content based features. We extract a content based feature vector from different parts of the blog - URLs, post content, etc. The dimensionality of the feature vector is reduced by Fisher linear discriminant analysis. We have tested an SVM based splog detector using proposed features on real world datasets, with excellent results (90{\%} accuracy).},

abstract = {The neuronal basis of hyperkinetic movement disorders has long been unclear. We now test the hypothesis that changes in the firing pattern of neurons in the globus pallidus internus (GPi) are related to dyskinesias induced by low doses of apomorphine in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). During pallidotomy for advanced PD, the activity of single neurons was studied both before and after administration of apomorphine at doses just adequate to induce dyskinesias (21 neurons, 17 patients). After the apomorphine injection, these spike trains demonstrated an initial fall in firing from baseline. In nine neurons, the onset of ON was simultaneous with that of dyskinesias. In these spike trains, the initial fall in firing rate preceded and was larger than the fall at the onset of ON with dyskinesias. Among the three neurons in which the onset of ON occurred before that of dyskinesias, the firing rate did not change at the time of onset of dyskinesias. After injection of apomorphine, dyskinesias during ON with dyskinesias often fluctuated between transient periods with dyskinesias and those without. Average firing rates were not different between these two types of transient periods. Transient periods with dyskinesias were characterized by interspike interval (ISI) independence, stationary spike trains, and higher variability of ISIs. A small but significant group of neurons demonstrated recurring ISI patterns during transient periods of ON with dyskinesias. These results suggest that mild dyskinesias resulting from low doses of apomorphine are related to both low GPi neuronal firing rates and altered firing patterns.},

The RDF2 program can be used to evaluate the significance of similarity scores using a shuffling method that preserves local sequence composition. The LFASTA program can display all the regions of local similarity between two sequences with scores greater than a threshold, using the same scoring parameters and a similar alignment algorithm; these local similarities can be displayed as a "graphic matrix" plot or as individual alignments.

We performed both linear and nonlinear analyses based on the cross correlation function (CCF) and recurrence plot quantification (RPQ), respectively. Recurrence plots were quantified by three variables: percent recurrence (PR), percent determinism (PD), and entropy of recurrences (ER). We recorded bipolar intra-atrial electrograms in two atrial sites during chronic AF in 19 informed subjects, following two protocols. In one, both recording sites were in the right atrium; in the other protocol, one site was in the right atrium, the other one in the left atrium. We extracted 19 episodes of type I AF (Wells' classification). RPQ detected transient recurrent patterns in all the episodes, while CCF was significant only in ten episodes. Surrogate data analysis, based on a cross-phase randomization procedure, decreased PR, PD, and ER values. The detection of spatiotemporal recurrent patterns together with the surrogate data results indicate that during AF a certain degree of local organization exists, likely caused by deterministic mechanisms of activation.},

abstract = {The development of ecological indicators for actively monitoring an ecosystem at a high resolution in scale, space and time is a challenge of primary interest. In this context, measures of structural complexity derived from close-range repeat photography may form a part of the solution. Moreover, recent mathematical tools, such as recurrence plots and recurrence quantification analysis (RP-RQA), are becoming accessible for characterizing the multivariate dynamics of natural systems given short, stochastic and non-stationary series. In this study, a total of 9360 grey-level digital images were recorded on a weekly basis across 72 sites in an old-growth forest ecosystem and analyzed for structural complexity. Structural complexity was assessed using an information theoretic measure (mean information gain). The effect of the scene scale on the observed dynamics was verified across a gradient of forest descriptors and light habitats. Multiscale dynamics responded nonlinearly to changes in scene scale, whereas seasonal trends in structural complexity showed a range of deterministic and stochastic behaviours. The determinism of multiscale time-series was related to sapling density, tree cover, and tree species richness. The sensitivity and flexibility of the RP-RQA approach applied to proxy measures of structural complexity in digital images forms an efficient methodology which might be used for actively monitoring forest ecosystems. This field study is one of the first to demonstrate that old-growth forest ecosystems behave like complex systems exhibiting nonlinear vegetation structure and dynamics across scales.},

abstract = {Synaptic Efficacy and the Transmission of Complex Firing Patterns Between Neurons. J. Neurophysiol. 84: 3010-3025, 2000. In central neurons, the summation of inputs from presynaptic cells combined with the unreliability of synaptic transmission produces incessant variations of the membrane potential termed synaptic noise (SN). These fluctuations, which depend on both the unpredictable timing of afferent activities and quantal variations of postsynaptic potentials, have defied conventional analysis. We show here that, when applied to SN recorded from the Mauthner (M) cell of teleosts, a simple method of nonlinear analysis reveals previously undetected features of this signal including hidden periodic components. The phase relationship between these components is compatible with the notion that the temporal organization of events comprising this noise is deterministic rather than random and that it is generated by presynaptic interneurons behaving as coupled periodic oscillators. Furthermore a model of the presynaptic network shows how SN is shaped both by activities in incoming inputs and by the distribution of their synaptic weights expressed as mean quantal contents of the activated synapses. In confirmation we found experimentally that long-term tetanic potentiation (LTP), which selectively increases some of these synaptic weights, permits oscillating temporal patterns to be transmitted more effectively to the postsynaptic cell. Thus the probabilistic nature of transmitter release, which governs the strength of synapses, may be critical for the transfer of complex timing information within neuronal assemblies.},

abstract = {Nonlinear time series analysis was used to estimate maximal Lyapunov exponents of select ankle and knee kinematics during three different conditions of treadmill walking: independent, side by side, and side by side with forced synchronization of stepping. Stride to stride variability was significantly increased for the condition in which individuals walked side by side and synchronized unintentionally when compared to the conditions of forced synchronization and independent walking. In addition, standard deviations of three kinematic variables of lower extremity movement were significantly increased during the condition in which unintentional synchronization occurred. No relationship was found between standard deviation and estimates of maximal Lyapunov exponents. An increase in kinematic variability during side by side walking for nonimpaired individuals who are not at risk of falling suggests that variability in certain aspects of performance might be indicative of a healthy system. Modeling this variability for an impaired individual to imitate may have beneficial effects on locomotor function. These results may therefore have implications for the rehabilitation of gait in humans by suggesting that a different functional outcome might be achieved by practicing side by side walking as opposed to more commonly used strategies involving independent walking.},

Two groups of healthy subjects were compared (11 young and 12 elderly) for two visual feedback conditions (eyes open and eyes closed). The data were analyzed using (i) classical stabilometric variables (length and surface) and (ii) recurrence quantification analysis (percentage of determinism and entropy), for the dynamical structure of COP signals. The length of the COP displacement was found to be the best discriminating stabilometric variable for both visual and aging effects. Visual feedback influenced recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) variables only for the elderly group. Both RQA outputs in the anterior posterior direction were sufficient to distinguish the young and elderly groups. The entropy estimation computed by RQA was significantly reduced for postural fluctuations in elderly people. We conclude that classical stabilometric variables and RQA outputs provide complementary information for the characterization of ageing effects on postural sway.},

Ten-min reading (sampling) interval was selected for the first half-year run followed by shorter (12 days) experiment with 5-s reading interval. A similar experiment was repeated later in the test borehole Sporilov (Prague, Czech Republic), where four temperature-time series were performed with reading intervals varying from 1 to 20 s. All temperature-time series (except the record from the bottom of the hole) displayed intermittent, non-periodic oscillations of temperature of up to several hundredths of degree with sharp gradients and large fluctuations over all observed time intervals. No such oscillation was detected at the bottom of the hole. The spectral analysis revealed a high level of stochasticity in the measured signal. Calculated spectra showed "band-pass" behavior without any definite peaks, which might characterize certain periodicity. Local growth of the second moment technique! revealed the presence of at least two distinct temperature-forming processes. One of them can be related to heat transfer in the structurally and compositionally complex subsurface. The second process, which presents the bulk of the measured signal, probably reflects certain intra-hole convection. We hypothesized that the oscillatory regime of such convection is responsible for the stochastic nature of measured temperatures. Results of numerical modeling describing the fluctuation of water-cells in a vertical slot support the idea of thermally unstable water column in a hole, the instability of which produces a complex oscillation system. Model solutions and their discussion is presented in Part II of this work.},

abstract = {This thesis examines the runoff of rivers from Southern Germany of the last decades. The aim is to detect possible changes and to identify and quantify collective phenomenons or specifics of particular gauges. This is done using the quantitative recurrence analysis (Eckmann et al. 1987, Zbilut and Webber 1992), a nonlinear, local method for examining dynamical systems. Another aim is to study the applicability of this quite new method on runoff time series. As data basis, 73 runoff time series of different rivers from the German states of Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg are used. The measurements in daily resolution cover a time period of 20 to 113 years. The main advantage of the quantitative recurrence analysis is its independence from constraints like stationarity, the type of distribution, the length of the data set and the amount of noise. This is of particular interest when analysing nonstationary, nonlinear runoff time series. Basis of the recurrence analysis is the recurrence plot, the distance matrix of the embedded scalar time series. Using the program rqa5.1 (Webber 1998), five so called RQA (recurrence quantification analysis) - characteristics are calculated (recurrence W, determinism D, line entropy H, longest diagonal line L and RP (recurrence plot) trend T). Examining the temporal evolution of these characteristics, information concerning the dynamics of the underlying processes and their behaviour in the state space can be derived. This information cannot be obtained using linear standard techniques. In this thesis, the parameters for the embedding (delay $\tau$and embedding dimension m) and the recurrence quantification analysis (radius r, window length f and minimally required diagonal line length lmin) were chosen very carefully. The applicability of the finally chosen parameters for analysing runoff time series is approved by a sensitivity analysis. Furthermore, it demonstrates that the results of the recurrence quantification analysis reflect the actual properties of the data and not those of the parameters. For the 42 Bavarian gauges, it is not possible to evaluate any changes in the runoff behaviour. The respective indicators (determinism, determinism/recurrence and line entropy) do not reveal a uniform trend for the different data sets. Two collective properties in the temporal evolution of the RQA-characteristics are detected. For most of the gauges, the ratio determinism/recurrence (D/W) and the line entropy show a dominant peak in the middle of the 1960s. Furthermore, the RP-trend of all analysed time series exhibits a significantly uniform long-term structure. This is an important result, because runoff time series do not belong to the known indicators for long-term fluctuations. Principal component analysises are performed for each Bavarian gauge using the different RQA-characteristics as variables. They indicate the statistical independence of the RQA-characteristics. RP-trend and determinism explain most of the observed temporal patterns. To detect possible connections between the uniform long-term structures in the RP-trend and different climate related long-term indices, cross-correlations are calculated between the respective time series. Here, the combination RP-trend and Southern Oscillation Index is the only one that shows a interpretable part of significant cross correlations. This thesis highlights the big potential of the quantitative recurrence analysis in studying runoff time series. This is because so far unknown properties of their nonlinear dynamics can be revealed. More studies considering known processes and different real world data sets are necessary in order to increase the understanding of the RQA-characteristics dependence on the parameters ($\tau$, m, r, f and lmin) and on the systems themselves.},

Here the authors combine advances in both sensing and signal analysis and demonstrate the ability to detect damage in a simple experimental structure. A distributed network of nine fiber-optic strain sensors is used to acquire time series data from a rectangular steel plate where damage is considered as a cut of varying lengths. Both the sensors and the associated optical hardware are described. A new feature, Holder continuity, is then introduced as a means of identifying the presence and location of the cut length. This particular metric is derived from the field of nonlinear dynamics and is based on a phase space description of a structure's dynamic response. Specifically, the authors compute the Holder exponent which quantifies the differentiability of the functional relationship between an 'undamaged' and a 'damaged' structural response. As damage is incurred, this relationship is expected to degrade. Both univariate and multivariate applications of the method are presented. The metric shows sensitivity to damage comparable to that exhibited by the plate's modal frequencies, a traditionally used feature in health monitoring applications.},

In this Letter, a recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) is proposed to describe dynamical characteristics of EEG (electroencephalograph) recordings on rat experiments, which is helpful to predict seizures. One of the advantages of this method does not require any assumptions to EEG data, such as linear, stationary, noiseless and so on. A series of experimental tests in this study show that the dynamical characteristics of EEG data with RQA can identify the differences among inter-ictal, pre-ictal and ictal phases; and support the hypothesis that complexity of brain electrical activity has a significant decrease prior to an epileptic seizure.

The analysis procedure includes both predictability and correlation analysis of the most important load and price indices.

The dynamics of Li ions in lithium silicate glasses have been characterized by van-Hove functions, fractal dimension of random walks, multifractal analysis of density profile, and principal component analyses of time series. Hierarchy dynamics with local and successive jumps, which are followed by cooperative jumps involving more ions, are observed in the self-part of the van-Hove functions and in trajectories where they form a multifractal density profile. Fractal dimensions of the random walks can be used to characterize the motions of ions in both the short and long length-scale regions. Difference between them becomes clearer in the glassy state, and the corresponding power law dependences of the mean squared displacements can be well explained by these exponents. Phase-space plot using the de-noised data obtained by principal component analysis reveals that the trajectory extending from the short time to the long time dynamics in the plot is continuous and has long term memory. The motion examined by the principal component analysis of the time series shows the deterministic character of the single particle ion dynamics. Each ion moves among domains of collective motion. Recurrence plot and mutual information function shows long correlation of the dynamics. Therefore, the cause of the dynamic heterogeneity is rather deterministic in nature.},

Three groups of rats were used as subjects to perform the experiments. Compared to a control group of male Sprague-Dawley rats (CON), a group of rats with tail-suspension (SUS) for 28 d was used to simulate cardiovascular deconditioning due to microgravity. Another group of tailed-suspended rats with daily STD for 1 h was used to provide -GX (dorso-ventral) gravitational loading as countermeasure. In addition to hemodynamic changes to head-up tilt, blood pressure variability (BPV) signals were also analyzed by spectral and nonlinear analysis. The results showed 1) Blood pressure immediately decreased after head-up tilt in all three groups. After several minutes, blood pressure could restore to the initial condition in both CON and SUS+STD group, but the recovery process was slower in the latter group. In contrast, the recovery process was the slowest in the SUS group and could not restore to the initial level completely. 2) In frequency domain, power spectra has similar pattern in CON and SUS+STD group. However, they are quite different in the SUS group in that spectra peak is obvious increased in very low frequency and spectra is narrower and higher in high frequency. 3) By nonlinear analysis of systolic blood pressure (SBP), it is clearly that approximate entropy (ApEn) value is similar in CON and SUS+STD groups, while the ApEn value of SUS group is higher as compared wit them. Our preliminary data have indicated that daily short-duration standing may help to prevent simulated microgravity-induced cardiovascular dysfunction in intact animal too.

abstract = {Electromagnetic fields (EMFs) having strengths typically found in the general environment can alter brain activity, but the reported effects have been inconsistent. We theorized that the problem arose from the use of linear methods for analyzing what were actually nonlinear phenomena, and therefore studied whether the nonlinear signal-processing technique known as recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) could be employed as the basis of a reliable method for demonstrating consistent changes in brain activity. Our primary purpose was to develop such a method for observing the occurrence of evoked potentials in individual subjects exposed to magnetic fields (2 G, 30 and 60 Hz). After all conditions that affected the analysis of the EEG were specified in advance, we detected magnetosensory evoked potentials (MEPs) in all 15 subjects (P {\textless} 0.05 in each experiment). The MEPs, which occurred within the predicted latency interval of 109{\&}ndash;504 ms, were independent of the frequency and the direction of the field, and were not detected using the traditional linear method of analysis, time averaging. When the results obtained within subjects were averaged across subjects, the evoked potentials could not be detected, indicating how real nonlinear phenomena can be averaged away when the incorrect method of analysis is used. Recurrence quantification analysis, but not linear analysis, permitted consistent demonstration of MEPs. The use of nonlinear analysis might also resolve apparent inconsistencies in other kinds of brain studies.},

abstract = {The enhanced graphic matrix procedure analyzes nucleic acid and amino acid sequences for features of possible biological interest and reveals the spatial patterns of such features. When a sequence is compared to itself the technique shows regions of self-complementarity, direct repeats, and palindromic subsequences. Comparison of two different sequences, exemplified by immunoglobulin kappa light chain genes, by using colored graphic matrices showed domains of similarity, regions of divergence, and features explainable by transpositions. Analysis of mouse constant domain immunoglobulin sequences revealed self-complementary regions that can be used to fold the molecule into a structure consistent with electron microscopic observations. Computer translation of nucleic acid sequences into all possible amino acid sequences followed by graphic matrix analysis provides a way to detect the most likely protein encoding regions and can predict the correct reading frames in sequences in which splicing patterns are not defined. Application of this technique to regions of simian virus 40 and polyoma virus demonstrates the frames of translation and shows the agreement of sequences determined in separate laboratories with different virus isolates. The graphic matrix technique can also be used to assembly fragmentary sequences during determination, to display local variations in base composition, to detect distant evolutionary relationships, and to display intragenic variation in rates of evolution.},

Autonomic control in diabetic subjects was assessed by the Ewing test. HR variability was explored by both linear and nonlinear methods. Linear methods used HR standard deviation and power spectrum. The percentage of the spectrum in the low frequencies was used to assess the sympathetic tone of the autonomic control. The nonlinear method used the "recurrence plot." This method explored long parallel subsequences in the HR time series. These sequences characterize the dependence of the HR dynamics on initial values. The HR standard deviation was reduced in the diabetic subjects compared with the healthy subjects (2.80 +/- 1.17 vs. 3.64 +/- 1.45 beats/min; P {\textless} 0.001). In the diabetic subjects, the HR standard deviation and the percentage of the spectrum in the low frequencies showed no correlations with the Ewing score (P {\textgreater} 0.10).

abstract = {Physiological systems are best characterized as complex dynamical processes that are continuously subjected to and updated by nonlinear feedforward and feedback inputs. System outputs usually exhibit wide varieties of behaviors due to dynamical interactions between system components, external noise perturbations, and physiological state changes. Complicated interactions occur at a variety of hierarchial levels and involve a number of interacting variables, many of which are unavailable for experimental measurement. In this paper we illustrate how recurrence plots can take single physiological measurements, project them into multidimensional space by embedding procedures, and identify time correlations (recurrences) that are not apparent in the one-dimensional time series. We extend the original description of recurrence plots by computing an array of specific recurrence variables that quantify the deterministic structure and complexity of the plot. We then demonstrate how physiological states can be assessed by making repeated recurrence plot calculations within a window sliding down any physiological dynamic. Unlike other predominant time series techniques, recurrence plot analyses are not limited by data stationarity and size constraints. Pertinent physiological examples from respiratory and skeletal motor systems illustrate the utility of recurrence plots in the diagnosis of nonlinear systems. The methodology is fully applicable to any rhythmical system, whether it be mechanical, electrical, neural, hormonal, chemical, or even spacial.},

The hole itself is 150 m deep and 112 mm in diameter. The experiment occurred in the internal plastic tube 5 cm in diameter which is sealed from the influx of ground water in the surrounding strata. In the studied interval the temperature gradient varies in the range of 0.020{\&}ndash;0.0215 K/m. The borehole was drilled in 1993 and has been in equilibrium since then. Temperature as a function of time was sampled in 15 s intervals and the individual measuring steps took from 1.5 to 2.5 days, each temperature time series thus contained 9000 up to 16,000 data points. The obtained results revealed: (1) temperature{\&}ndash;time series present a complex apparently random oscillation pattern with the amplitude of up to 0.045 K; (2) the statistical analysis confirmed a quasi-periodic skeleton of a two-frequency oscillation structure.

Disordered sustained vowels exhibit wide-ranging phenomena, from nearly periodic to highly complex, aperiodic vibrations, and increased "breathiness". Modelling and surrogate data studies have shown significant nonlinear and non-Gaussian random properties in these sounds. Nonetheless, existing tools are limited to analysing voices displaying near periodicity, and do not account for this inherent biophysical nonlinearity and non-Gaussian randomness, often using linear signal processing methods insensitive to these properties. They do not directly measure the two main biophysical symptoms of disorder: complex nonlinear aperiodicity, and turbulent, aeroacoustic, non-Gaussian randomness. Often these tools cannot be applied to more severe disordered voices, limiting their clinical usefulness.{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}b{\textgreater}Methods{\textless}/b{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}This paper introduces two new tools to speech analysis: recurrence and fractal scaling, which overcome the range limitations of existing tools by addressing directly these two symptoms of disorder, together reproducing a "hoarseness" diagram.

Recurrence plots and first or third order Poincar{\&}eacute; maps combined with surrogate shuffling revealed nonrandom patterns consistent with the notion that synaptic noise is a continuously varying mixture of periodic and chaotic phases. Chaos was further demonstrated by the occurrence of unstable periodic orbits. The nonrandom component of the noise is reproducibly and persistently reduced when the level of background sound, a natural stimulus for networks afferent to the Mauthner cell, is briefly elevated. These data are consistent with a model involving a reciprocally connected inhibitory network, presynaptic to the Mauthner cell and its intrinsic properties. The presence of chaos in the inhibitory synaptic noise that regulates the excitability of the Mauthner cell and its sensitivity to external stimuli suggests that it modulates this neuron's function, namely to trigger a fast escape motor reaction following unexpected sensory information.},

Surface EMGs of the biceps brachii muscle were recorded from 14 healthy human volunteers during light and heavy loadings, and task failure occurred at varying times among the subjects. Digitized EMG signals were analyzed by linear spectral analysis (fast Fourier transform) and nonlinear recurrence-plot analysis. With light loading, computed variables from both analyses gave "quasi-steady-state" values over time, with recurrence-plot analysis having the higher variance. With heavy loading, the nonlinear variable ({\%}determinism) increased sooner and exhibited larger changes from control values than decreases in the linear variable (spectral center frequency). Experimental results support the conclusion that both analyses can be combined to give a fuller assessment of the biceps EMG during light or heavy loading.

Relatively few studies were focused on autonomic neuropathy in young adults with diabetes mellitus (DM) type 1. The aim of this study was to find out which of the heart rate variability parameters derived from recurrence plot (recurrence quantification analysis parameters) are different in young patients with DM compared to control group. We have quantified various recurrence plot measures. From RQA measures based on diagonal lines in recurrence plots, we have found higher percentage of recurrence and of determinism and increased maximal length of diagonal line in DM group. Parameter Trapping Time was higher in DM group compared to control subjects. These results suggests reduced complexity and increased predictability of heart rate dynamics even in young patients with DM. RQA parameters should be used together with other HRV parameters for better description of heart rate dysregulation in various patients groups.},

abstract = {Nonlinear time series analysis was used to estimate maximal Lyapunov exponents of select ankle and knee kinematics during three different conditions of treadmill walking: independent, side by side, and side by side with forced synchronization of stepping. Stride to stride variability was significantly increased for the condition in which individuals walked side by side and synchronized unintentionally when compared to the conditions of forced synchronization and independent walking. In addition, standard deviations of three kinematic variables of lower extremity movement were significantly increased during the condition in which unintentional synchronization occurred. No relationship was found between standard deviation and estimates of maximal Lyapunov exponents. An increase in kinematic variability during side by side walking for nonimpaired individuals who are not at risk of falling suggests that variability in certain aspects of performance might be indicative of a healthy system. Modeling this variability for an impaired individual to imitate may have beneficial effects on locomotor function. These results may therefore have implications for the rehabilitation of gait in humans by suggesting that a different functional outcome might be achieved by practicing side by side walking as opposed to more commonly used strategies involving independent walking.},

abstract = {This paper introduces new adaptive methodology for monitoring of variability (level of chaos) of complex time series by utilization of cognitive capabilities of nonconventional neural architectures. Real-time sample-by-sample evaluation of complex system behavior is based on monitoring of adaptable parameters of neural architectures during their adaptation. The level and changes of complexity of system behavior are adaptively monitored in real time and can be stored for further evaluation. The proposed technique performs sensitivity-scalable sample-by-sample monitoring and variability change detection of system behavior that is achieved as the system output behavior is transformed to approximated system parameter space by the adaptation of a special forced higher-order nonlinear neural unit. The nonconventional neural unit is implemented as an adaptive forced nonlinear dynamic oscillators, i.e., with adaptable forcing periodic inputs. Adding forcing adaptable inputs increases the approximating capability of neural architecture; the forcing adaptable neural inputs are initially configured upon analysis of frequency spectra of the evaluated time series. It is demonstrated that monitoring of system parameters during the adaptation of forced dynamic neural architecture can reveal important attributes of complex system behavior in real time, and it is capable of sensitive both instantaneous and long-term monitoring of changes of chaotic system behavior. In principle, the proposed methodology is universal and is not limited to evaluation of only time series and not only by nonconventional neural units. Simulation results on deterministic, however, highly chaotic data are shown to explain the new methodology and to demonstrate its capability to reflect the level of chaos in a signal and to detect small changes of chaos in a signal.},

We found that the spatial distribution of leech position in a uniform environment is isotropic (the same in all directions), but this isotropy is broken in the presence of localized external stimuli. In the time domain, transitions among behaviors can be described by a Markov process, the structure of which (allowed states and transitions) is highly conserved across individuals. Finally, a wide range of recurrent, deterministic motifs was identified in the apparently irregular and unstructured exploratory behavior. These results provide a rigorous description of the inner dynamics that control the spontaneous and continuous flow of behavioral decisions in the leech.},

abstract = {The detection process by which animals react to the presence of electromagnetic fields (EMFs) may be a form of sensory transduction. However, the anatomic location of signal transduction in most species is unknown. Attempts to solve this problem by applying local EMFs and registering the resulting changes in the electroencephalogram (EEG) have not succeeded because of the nonstationarity of the EEG and the insensitivity of linear methods of analysis. We approached the problem of localizing electroreception in rabbits by using recurrence quantification analysis (RQA), a novel method of nonlinear analysis designed to detect small deterministic changes in a larger signal irrespective of considerations involving stationarity. When 2.5 G, 60 Hz was applied to the entire body, increased determinism in the EEG was found in all 10 animals studied, as evidenced by statistically significant increases in two RQA quantifiers. A similar result occurred when the field was applied only to the front half of each animal, but no effect on the EEG was seen when the field was applied only to the back half. When the field was localized to the head, the effect on the determinism in the EEG was again seen. When the field was further localized to the eye, the effect did not occur. Overall, the results indicated that detection of the field occurred in cells or extracellular structures in the head, probably the brain, although the methods used did not have the resolution to discriminate between specific brain structures. Thus, our results showed that the presence of transient deterministic brain states induced by an EMF signal could be documented using dynamical analysis, thereby allowing us to infer the approximate anatomic location of the signal's transduction.},

abstract = {We studied visual discrimination learning in a group of Nigerian dwarf goats using a computer-based learning device which was integrated in the animals' home pen. We conducted three consecutive learning tasks (T1, T2 and T3), each of which lasted for 13 days. In each task, a different set of four visual stimuli was presented on a computer screen in a four-choice design. Predefined sequences of stimulus combinations were presented in a pseudorandom order. Animals were rewarded with drinking water when they chose the positive stimulus by pressing a button next to it. Noninvasive measurements of goats' heartbeat intervals were carried out on the first and the last 2 days of each learning task. We analysed heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) of resting animals to study sustained physiological effects related to general learning challenge rather than acute excitement during an actual learning session. The number of trials to reach the learning criterion was 1000 in T1, when visual stimuli were presented to the goats for the first time, but decreased to 210 in T2 and 240 in T3, respectively. A stable plateau of correct choices between 70{\%} and 80{\%} was reached on Day 10 in T1, on Day 8 in T2 and on Day 6 in T3. We found a significant influence of the task and of the interaction between task and day on learning success. Whereas HR increased throughout T1, this relationship was inverted in T2 and T3, indicating different effects on the HR depending on how familiar goats were with the learning task. We found a significant influence of the task and the interaction between task and time within the task on HRV parameters, indicating changes of vagal activity at the heart. The results suggest that changes in HR related to learning were predominantly caused by a withdrawal of vagal activity at the heart. With regard to nonlinear processes in heartbeat regulation, increased deterministic shares of HRV indicated that the animals did not really relax until the end of T3. Comparing changes of HR and HRV in T3 and in a subsequent postexperiment (PE), we assume a positive effect of such cognitive challenges once the task had been learned by the animals.},

On the one hand, the choice of ultradian alternations of rest and activity bouts makes it possible for every mouse to maximize its net energy gain over a one-day or a one-night interval. On the other hand, the succession of acts performed within an activity bout might serve to precisely fit the metabolic needs of each animal, because the corresponding results present great inter-individual variability, with some mice increasing and others decreasing their net energy gain. To determine what kind of dynamic system could generate these successions of acts within an activity bout, we performed a nonlinear time series analysis of the energy costs related to the acts displayed by the mice during such a period. The results suggest that chaotic dynamics might be involved in action selection in mice. Thus, the variability mentioned above could be a consequence of the sensitive dependence on initial conditions associated with such dynamics, and would allow mice to rapidly adapt their metabolic needs to the ongoing situation.},

abstract = {Since its introduction in 1890, by Henri Poincar�e, the notion of recurrence of a system has become essential and very popular in the dynamical systems theory. Particularly, in the recent years, the concept of recurrence matrices and recurrence plots have proved to be highly useful for the analysis of a wide range of dynamical models and real world systems. The main part of the thesis is devoted to address one of the highly relevant problem of data analysis -- the short or missing data sets. In such cases, deciphering the characteristics of the underlying system by using any conventional time series analysis techniques might not be possible, as many of these techniques, including recurrence plots, require temporally continuous data sets. In this thesis an automated algorithm is proposed based on the concept of recurrences, to overcome the important problem of short data sets or missing values. The method generates long artificial phase space trajectories -- called Dynamically Reconstructed Trajectories (DRTs) -- from a collection of short data sets. These dynamical replicants can then be easily characterised by the traditional time series analysis methods to extract the required dynamical details. More importantly, the DRTs generated by the algorithm reproduces the short and the long term dynamics of an underlying systems rather closely. The technique in its present form can be successfully applied to an ensemble of short trajectories, portions of which belong to different, but well separated, basins of attraction or to sharply divided phase space. Furthermore, the generality of the approach allows us to numerically characterise the properties of the chaotic saddles by generating an artificial long trajectory from a given aggregate of transiently chaotic trajectories. Moreover, the necessary procedures for the analysis of short scalar data sets are advocated and they are validated with a chemical oscillator data. The method might also be also useful to detect the existence of chaotic synchronisation, when only short trajectories/time series are available, from two or more interacting systems for analysis. Furthermore, in this work, the potential of the recurrence plots based approaches is illustrated by employing it to high-resolution EEG recordings and climate data sets.},

abstract = {The classical description of ventriculoarterial coupling by calculating the ratio between the effective arterial elastance Ea to the end-systolic elastance Ees does not give insight into the underlying dynamics of the interaction between left-ventricular pressure (LVP) and aortic pressure (AOP) and flow (AOF). The aim of this study was to introduce a state space representation for the ventriculoarterial coupling and to quantify changes of the coupling state. METHODS: A ventriculoarterial state space orbit VAO was defined to be dependent on three variables: VAO = [LVP(t), AOP(t + delta t), AOF(t + delta t)]. Changes in the coupling effect directly or indirectly on the time series of these parameters. They reflect the actual state of the cardiovascular system. The time delay delta t between the LVP and the aortic signals takes respect to the short delay between the heart action and the resulting waves in the arterial tree. The recurrence map of the VAO(i) (i = 1 .. N, N = number of points) is constructed by plotting the index i of every single point on the orbit (x-axis) against the indices of his 10 nearest neighbors (y-axis) in distance. The data were recorded in 9 anaesthetized pigs with a sample frequency of 512 Hz over a period of 6 seconds using piezoelectric pressure sensors and a Doppler flowmeter. A control condition was compared to a total occlusion of the descending aorta as a strong artificial disturbance of ventriculoarterial interaction. The nonlinear parameters percent recurrence, percent determinism and the entropy were calculated from the plot. RESULTS: Periodic crossing points and forbidden zones in all plots identify the nonlinear character of the chosen variables. The recurrent patterns are less rigid for control conditions than for total occlusion. Entropy (2.3{\%} rise) and determinism (24{\%} rise) are significantly (p {\textless} 0.003) increased. Total aortic occlusion leads to more complex time correlation patterns. CONCLUSIONS: These results may reflect the loss of an ideal coupling state leading to a more complex deterministic behavior of the overall regulatory system. Because recurrence plots do not impose rigid constraints on data set size, stationarity, or statistical distribution, we hypothesize that this technique might be useful to describe the nonlinear dynamics between left ventricle and arterial system.},

abstract = {A pair of proteins is defined to be related by a circular permutation if the N-terminal region of one protein has significant sequence similarity to the C-terminal of the other and vice versa. To detect pairs of proteins that might be related by circular permutation, we implemented a procedure based on a combination of a fast screening algorithm that we had designed and manual verification of candidate pairs. The screening algorithm is a variation of a dynamic programming string matching algorithm, in which one of the sequences is doubled. This algorithm, although not guaranteed to identify all cases of circular permutation, is a good first indicator of protein pairs related by permutation events. The candidate pairs were further validated first by application of an exhaustive string matching algorithm and then by manual inspection using the dotplot visual tool. Screening the whole Swissprot database, a total of 25 independent protein pairs were identified. These cases are presented here, divided into three categories depending on the level of functional similarity of the related proteins. To validate our approach and to confirm further the small number of circularly permuted protein pairs, a systematic search for cases of circular permutation was carried out in the Pfam database of protein domains. Even with this more inclusive definition of a circular permutation, only seven additional candidates were found. None of these fitted our original definition of circular permutations. The small number of cases of circular permutation suggests that there is no mechanism of local genetic manipulation that can induce circular permutations; most examples observed seem to result from fusion of functional units.},

abstract = {Human subjects respond to low-intensity electric and magnetic fields. If the ability to do so were a form of sensory transduction, one would expect that fields could trigger evoked potentials, as do other sensory stimuli. We tested this hypothesis by examining electroencephalograms from 17 subjects for the presence of evoked potentials caused by the onset and by the offset of 2 G, 60 Hz (a field strength comparable to that in the general environment). Both linear (time averaging) and nonlinear (recurrence analysis) methods of data analysis were employed to permit an assessment of the dynamical nature of the stimulus/response relationship. Using the method of recurrence analysis, magnetosensory evoked potentials (MEPs) in the signals from occipital derivations were found in 16 of the subjects (P{\textless}0.05 for each subject). The potentials occurred 109-454 ms after stimulus application, depending on the subject, and were triggered by onset of the field, offset of the field, or both. Using the method of time averaging, no MEPs were detected. MEPs in the signals from the central and parietal electrodes were found in most subjects using recurrence analysis, but no MEPs were detected using time averaging. The occurrence of MEPs in response to a weak magnetic field suggested the existence of a human magnetic sense. In distinction to the evoked potentials ordinarily studied, MEPs were nonlinearly related to the stimulus as evidenced by the need to employ a nonlinear method to detect the responses.},

We suspected that the use of linear methods and models accounted for some of the variability, and we explored the issue by using a novel approach to study the effects of EMFs on the electroencephalogram (EEG) from rabbits. The EEG was embedded in phase space and local recurrence plots were calculated and quantified to permit comparisons between exposed and control epochs from individual animals. Statistically significant alterations in brain activity were observed in each animal (n=10) when it was exposed to 2.5 G, 60 Hz, as assessed using each of two recurrence-plot quantifiers. Each result was replicated; a positive-control procedure ruled out the possibility that the effect of the field was a product of the method of analysis. Measurements performed while the rabbits were under anesthesia suggested that the effect was mediated by N-methyl--aspartate and/or $\alpha$2-adrenoceptors. No differences were found between exposed and control epochs in any animal when the experiment was repeated after the rabbits had been killed, indicating that a putative interaction between the field and the EEG electrodes could not account for the observed effects. We conclude that EMF transduction resulting in changes in brain electrical activity could be demonstrated consistently using a nonlinear method of analysis.},

Cross recurrence plots exhibit characteristic structures which can be used for the study of differences between two processes or for the alignment and search for matching sequences of two data series.

The TOP method consists in searching for a robust noise-averaged optimal path of the distance matrix along which the two time series have the greatest similarity. Here, we generalize the TOP method by introducing a more general definition of distance which takes into account possible regime shifts between positive and negative correlations. This generalization to track possible changes of correlation signs is able to identify possible transitions from one convention (or consensus) to another. Numerical simulations on synthetic time series verify that the new TOP method performs as expected even in the presence of substantial noise. We then apply it to investigate changes of convention in the dependence structure between the historical volatilities of the USA inflation rate and economic growth rate.

This law is applicable not only to the comparison of physical stimulus intensities but also to qualitative comparative judgments, such as those of excellence of specimens in an educational scale. It should be possible also to verify it on comparative judgments which involve simultaneous and successive contrast. The law is stated as follows:[Equation omitted]in which S-sub(1) and S-sub(2) are the psychological scale values of the two compared stimuli; x-sub(12) is the sigma value corresponding to the proportion of judgments p-sub(1) {\textgreater} p-sub(2). ?-sub(1) is the discriminal dispersion of stimulus R-sub(1) and ?-sub(2) is the dispersion of stimulus R-sub(2). r is the correlation between the discriminal deviations of R-sub(1) and R-sub(2) in the same judgment. This law is basic for work on Weber's and Fechner's laws, applies to the judgments of a single observer who compares a series of stimuli by the method of paired comparisons when no "equal" judgments are allowed, and is a rational equation for the method of constant stimuli. The law is then applied to five cases each of which involves different assumptions and different degrees of simplification of the law for practical use. The weighting of the observation equations is discussed because the observation equations obtained with the five cases are not of the same reliability and hence should not be equally weighted.},

From an analysis of the aminoacid sequence, different constraints appear to act on the borders and on the central part of the insertions.

Three nonlinear indexes [percentage of recurrence, percentage of determinism, and length index (Lmax)] extracted from the recurrence plot method were used to analyze the BP signal. Sympathetic but not parasympathetic blockade reduced BP level and its LF component. RR increased and decreased after [beta]- and[alpha] -blockades, respectively. Hexamethonium increased HF, and atropine reduced LF, of RR. Sympathetic blockade and, in particular, [alpha]-sympathetic blockade increased nonlinear indexes of BP. In contrast, parasympathetic blockade by atropine increased nonlinear indexes of RR.

The proposed method is able to distinguish between synchronization of spikes and synchronization of bursts, so that we analyze the synchronization of each time scale separately. We find for all network topologies that the synchronization of the bursts sets in for smaller coupling strengths than the synchronization of the spikes. Furthermore, we obtain an interesting behavior for the synchronization of the spikes dependent on the coupling strength: for small values of the coupling, the synchronization of the spikes increases, but for intermediate values of the coupling, the synchronization index of the spikes decreases. For larger values of the coupling strength, the synchronization index increases again until all the spikes synchronize.},

For the purpose of prediction, a genetically optimised modular neural network architecture is developed. Findings indicate that the regimes in critical flow near capacity (where traffic flow exhibits unstable nonlinear evolution) are more difficult to predict when compared to the free-flow and jammed conditions. Moreover, the predictability of the critical-flow regimes decreases sharply in multiple-steps-ahead prediction, whereas the predictability of the regimes where traffic flow exhibits a more stable temporal behaviour is less affected by the expansion of the predictive horizon. Finally, a comparative study shows that the proposed modular neural network represents more accurately the anticipated traffic flow regimes when compared to the modular neural networks trained without the statistical information on the traffic flow evolution.},

A significant parameter of such images, the frame wise average intensity value is extracted separately and arranged in sequence for constructing the time series. Since this time series is found to be non-stationary in nature and due to the fact that the turning operation is low dimensional chaotic, the nonlinear time series analysis methodology of RQA is used for analyzing the time series. The present study ascertains that the derived time series do have a deterministic origin and it further investigates the sensitivity of the different RQA variables to chatter cutting by analyzing this time series and demonstrates that this methodology is capable of capturing the transition from regular cutting to the chatter cutting.},

The presence of memory effects and evolutionary processes demonstrate that the local history of these systems, embedded in an environment which is also partially created by them, is of utmost inportance. There is no phase space for these systems. We therefore conjecture to characterize the system by its input-output mapping, considering it as a filter.

Using the EODs proprieties, one species of the Apteronotidae family was selected to biomonitoring studies, among those more abundant species that inhabit rivers in the surrounding Manaus-AM. The study of apteronotids EODs allowed the confection of specifics algorithms to MatLab? (toolboxes Wavelet,s and CRP - NDG Univ. Potsdam). Wavelets and recurrence analyses were utilized, in addition to the traditional method of spectrum density based in the fast fourrier transformation (FFT). Apteronotus hasemani was the species elected, and it waveform standard patterns were established. Using the waveform standard patterns a method was established to detect different concentrations of BTX (2, 10, 20 e 100 mg/L) for each specimen of A. hasemani. Considering that the water soluble fraction of the oil, the composites of BTX (benzene, toluene and xylenes) are more toxics and less hidrophobics. Using this methodology was possible to infer on the positive detection of BTX for specimens of A. hasemani with the minimal concentration of 10 mg/L.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of exposure to altitude on muscle endurance during isometric contractions. Six sedentary subjects were studied. Surface electromyograph (sEMG) activity was recorded from the right biceps brachii (BB) during exhausting isometric exercise at 80{\%} maximal voluntary contraction. Experiments were performed before, during and 6 months after a 12 day stay at the EV-K2 laboratory (Nepal, 5,050 m above sea level). From the sEMG signals from BB, the median frequencies (fmed) were computed for consecutive 1 s epochs. The sEMG was also analysed using a non-linear tool, the recurrence quantification analysis, and the percentage of determinism ({\%}DET) was then calculated. The haemoglobin saturation significantly decreased at altitude. The mean (SD) BB endurance time decreased from 22.4 (4) s to 18.3 (4.7) s (P{\textless}0.05). After exposure to altitude a significant variation in fmed and {\%}DET slopes was observed. We concluded that during the first period of acclimatisation at altitude there was an impairment of isometric muscle endurance performance and there was also evidence of a modified myoelectric activity pattern suggesting a greater fatigability of the neuromuscular system.},

abstract = {The variability of coupled rhythmic limb movements is assumed to be a consequence of the strength of a movement's attractor dynamic and a constant stochastic noise process that continuously perturbs the movement system away from this dynamic. Recently, it has been suggested that the nonlinear technique of recurrence analysis can be used to index the effects of noise and attractor strength on movement variability. To test this, three experiments were conducted in which the attractor strength of bimanual wrist-pendulum movements (using coordination mode, movement frequency and detuning), as well as the magnitude of stochastic perturbations affecting the variability of these movements (using a temporally fluctuating visual metronome) was manipulated. The results of these experiments demonstrate that recurrence analysis can index parametric changes in the attractor strength of coupled rhythmic limb movements and the magnitude of metronome induced stochastic perturbations independently. The results of Experiments 1 and 2 also support the claim that differences between the variability of inphase and antiphase coordination, and between slow and fast movement frequencies are due to differences in attractor strength. In contrast to the standard assumption that the noise that characterizes interlimb coordination remains constant for different magnitudes of detuning ({\&}Delta; {\&}omega;) the results of Experiment 3 suggest that the magnitude of noise increases with increases in |{\&}Delta; {\&}omega;|.},

For each of the five systems the 2-dimensional grid of initial conditions contained 80 eccentricity points for the Jovian planet and up to 160 semimajor axis points for the fictitious planet.

abstract = {In the analysis of coupled systems, various techniques have been developed to model and detect dependencies from observed bivariate time series. Most well-founded methods, like Granger-causality and partial coherence, are based on the theory of linear systems: on correlation functions, spectra and vector autoregressive processes. In this paper we discuss a nonlinear approach using recurrence.{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}Recurrence, which intuitively means the repeated occurrence of a very similar situation, is a basic notion in dynamical systems. The classical theorem of Poincar?e says that for every dynamical system with an invariant probability measure P, almost every point in a set B will eventually return to B. Moreover, for ergodic systems the mean recurrence time is 1/P(B). Details of recurrence patterns were studied when chaotic systems came into the focus of research, and it turned out that they are linked to Lyapunov exponents, generalized entropies, the correlation sum, and generalized dimensions.{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}Our goal here is to develop methods for time series which typically contain a few hundreds or thousands of values and which need not come from a stationary source. While Poincar{\&}eacute;'s theorem holds for stationary stochastic processes, and linear methods require stationarity at least for suficiently large windows, recurrence methods need less stationarity. We outline different concepts of recurrence by specifying different classes of sets B. Then we visualize recurrence and define recurrence parameters similar to autocorrelation.{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}We are going to apply recurrence to the analysis of bivariate data. The basic idea is that coupled systems show similar recurrence patterns. We can study joint recurrences as well as cross-recurrence. We shall see that bothapproaches have their benefits and drawbacks. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}Model systems of coupled oscillators form a test bed for analysis of bivariate time series since the corresponding differential equations involve a parameter which precisely defines the degree of coupling. Changing the parameter we can switch to phase synchronization and generalized synchronization. The approaches of cross- and joint recurrence are compared for several models. In view of possible experimental requirements, recurrence is studied on ordinal scale as well as on metric scale. Several quantities for the description of synchronization are derived and illustrated. Finally, two different applications to EEG data will be presented.},

The well-established paradigm of precision-aiming is taken as a methodological framework here. Evidence is provided that movement variability in closed tasks is not a random phenomenon, but rather shows a coherent temporal structure, referred to as 1/f scaling. The scaling relation appears more clearly as participants become trained in a highly constrained motor task. Also Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) and Sample Entropy (SampEn) as analytic tools show that variation of movement times becomes less random and more patterned with motor learning. This suggests that motor learning can be regarded as an emergent, dynamical fusing of collaborating subsystems into a lower-dimensional organization. These results support the idea that 1/f scaling is ubiquitous throughout the cognitive system, and suggest that it plays a fundamental role in the coordination of cognitive as well as motor function.},

Knowledge of transitions from regular to chaotic behavior is essential to understand the underlying dynamics of nonlinear switching circuits. While linear approaches are often insufficient to describe such processes, there are nonlinear methods available but requires long time observations. To overcome these difficulties, a newly developed pattern recognition method of nonlinear dynamics called Recurrence plot analysis method is proposed to detect transitions between periodic and chaotic states. The recurrence plot is a two-dimensional representation technique that brings out distance correlations in a time series and make it instantly apparent whether a system is periodic or chaotic. In this paper, the proposed method is applied to a nonlinear switching Buck converter, Boost converter, and Buck-Boost converters to analyze their period doubling route to chaos behavior and to distinguish chaos from noisy behavior. This may lead to a better understanding of the nonlinear switching systems, that may allow us to design stable, chaotic free switching circuits.},

We think that this phenomenon can be explained by taking into account some behaviors observed in the model by Ishizaka and Flanagan of the vocal folds. Chaotic behaviors have been found in the cries of healthy infants as well as infants with several perinatal complications. We show that these phenomena also appear in healthy infants and are related to the newborn's pain intensity. Under the point of view of the dissipative systems, pain acts as a bifurcation parameter for the motion of the vocal folds.

abstract = {The prevailing theoretical approach to variability and motor control of gait is to treat the within-subject variability as a reflection of noise in the sensorimotor system. Another way to conceptualize noise is to consider the sensorimotor system as a non-linear dynamic system. Here noise is viewed as part of the dynamics and not as superimposed components. Thus noise contributes to the qualitative properties of the dynamic output and not merely to the quantitative properties. This formulation holds the interesting property that noise can be beneficial to the system in the sense of facilitating the adaptation to task demands.With the help of two shoes with eight built-in force sensors and a portable data logger (InfotronicTM) we recorded vertical force peaks during healthy gait during a time interval of 160 s. The data allows assessment of the stationarity of the time series. The time demand to get a stable gait pattern was monitored in dependence on the gait velocity. The stationarity is characterized at first by the recurrence plot, a graphical tool for the diagnosis of drift and hidden periodicities. Further analysis is performed to discriminate between a noisy periodic signal and deterministic chaotic dynamics. The aim of the investigation is to introduce the fractal dimension of the time series of essential gait parameters for the assessment of a practical number of degrees of freedom in the motor control of gait.},

The EEG signals are highly subjective and the information about the various states may appear at random in the time scale.

We present an algorithm based on a recurrence time statistic which is sensitive to changes in a reconstructed state space, particularly for detection of transitions with very low energy. Heart sound signals from ten children were used in this study. Most S3 occurrences were detected (98{\%}), but the amount of false extra detections was rather high (7{\%} of the heart cycles).

The description of form consists of a segmentation of the piece into musical parts, grouping of the segments representing the same part, and assigning musically meaningful labels, such as ldquochorusrdquo or ldquoverse,rdquo to the groups. The method uses a fitness function for the descriptions to select the one with the highest match with the acoustic properties of the input piece. Different aspects of the input signal are described with three acoustic features: mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, chroma, and rhythmogram. The features are used to estimate the probability that two segments in the description are repeats of each other, and the probabilities are used to determine the total fitness of the description. Creating the candidate descriptions is a combinatorial problem and a novel greedy algorithm constructing descriptions gradually is proposed to solve it. The group labeling utilizes a musicological model consisting of N-grams. The proposed method is evaluated on three data sets of musical pieces with manually annotated ground truth. The evaluations show that the proposed method is able to recover the structural description more accurately than the state-of-the-art reference method.},

The objective of this paper is to illustrate how the MRP-RQA (multivariate recurrence plot-recurrence quantification analysis) approach may serve to characterize ecosystems driven by both deterministic and stochastic forces. The strength of the MRP-RQA approach resides in its independence from constraining assumptions regarding outliers, noise, stationarity and transients. Its utility is demonstrated by means of two spatiotemporal series (summer and spring datasets) of light intensity variations in an old growth forest ecosystem. Results revealed qualitative differences in homogeneity, transiency, and drift typologies between the MRPs derived from each dataset. RQA estimates of determinism and Kolmogorov entropy supported the idea that mixed chaotic-stochastic dynamics may be common in mesoscale forest habitats. Advantages and inconveniences of the MRP-RQA approach are also discussed in the more general context of monitoring ecosystems.},

abstract = {The principal forces of protein folding--hydrophobicity and conformational entropy--are nonspecific. A long-standing puzzle has, therefore, been: What forces drive the formation of the specific internal architectures in globular proteins? We find that any self-avoiding flexible polymer molecule will develop large amounts of secondary structure, helices and parallel and antiparallel sheets, as it is driven to increasing compactness by any force of attraction among the chain monomers. Thus structure formation arises from the severity of steric constraints in compact polymers. This steric principle of organization can account for why short helices are stable in globular proteins, why there are parallel and anti-parallel sheets in proteins, and why weakly unfolded proteins have some secondary structure. On this basis, it should be possible to construct copolymers, not necessarily using amino acids, that can collapse to maximum compactness in incompatible solvents and that should then have structural organization resembling that of proteins. },

In performing a quantitative assessment of dynamical transition patterns of IP-network traffic, we used the values of determinism (DET) defined by the recurrence quantification analysis (RQA). Also, in evaluating fractal-related properties of IP-network traffic, we employed the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), which is applicable to the analysis of long-range dependence (LRD) in nonstationary time-series signals. Furthermore, to obtain a comprehensive view of network traffic conditions, we used a self-organizing map, which provides a way to map high-dimensional data onto a low-dimensional domain. When applying this method to traffic analysis, we performed two kinds of traffic measurement in Tokyo, Japan, and derived values of DET and the LRD-based scaling parameteralphaof IP-network traffic. Then, we found that the characteristic with respect to DET and self-similarity seen in the measured traffic fluctuated over time, with different time variation patterns for two measurements. In training the self-organizing map, we used three parameters: average throughput, variation ratio of DET, and {\&}alpha;-value. As a result, we visually confirmed that the traffic data could be projected onto the map in accordance with traffic properties, resulting in a combined depiction of the effects of the DET and network utilization rates on the time-variations of LRD.},

Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is a sensitive tool for assessment of cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction. As the heart is controlled by non-linear deterministic system, the non-linear dynamics measures should be preferred. Recurrence plot (RP) is able to analyse recurrences within system dynamics. The aim of the study was to detect heart rate dysregulation in DM by RP and to ascertain which of the recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) measures are changed in patients with DM compared to control group. We analysed HRV recordings from 17 young patients with type 1 DM and 17 healthy matched control subjects. RQA was performed on RPs with a fixed value of recurrence points percentage. From RQA measures based on diagonal lines, we have found higher percentage of determinism in DM group (P=0.038). Trapping time measure was also higher in DM (P=0.022). RQA revealed changes in dynamics recurrences with reduced complexity of heart rate control in young diabetic patients. As RQA parameters are independent of overall HRV, parameters of RP should be used together with linear HRV parameters for better description of heart rate dysregulation in patients with diabetics.},

A new technique, called slope constraint, is successfully introduced, in which the warping function slope is restricted so as to improve discrimination between words in different categories. The effective slope constraint characteristic is determined through experiments.

abstract = {Both the association between lymphocytic thyroiditis (LT) and papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), and the prognostic significance of lymphocytic infiltrate in patients with thyroid malignancy, remain controversial. We examine the above relationships by retrospectively reviewing our series of patients treated for differentiated nonmedullary thyroid carcinoma at University of California-San Francisco over a 25-yr period (1970-1995). Of the 631 patients with complete data for analysis, 128 patients (20.3{\%}) showed concomitant histologic evidence of LT and 503 patients (79.7{\%}) had no evidence of LT. Prognostic outcome was assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival plots and analysis of risk factors by Cox's proportional-hazard modeling. The cohort with LT revealed a higher frequency of PTC (97.7{\%} vs. 87.3{\%}) and female patients (85.2{\%} vs. 66.8{\%}), a lower frequency of extrathyroidal invasion (7.8{\%} vs. 23.3{\%}) and nodal metastases (25.8{\%} vs. 43.3{\%}), and absence of distant metastases (0{\%} vs. 4.8{\%}), respectively, compared with those without LT. At initial surgery, a significantly greater proportion of patients with LT belonged to lower pathological tumor-node-metastasis stages, compared with those without LT (stage 1, 86.7{\%} vs. 73{\%}; stage 2, 4.7{\%} vs. 8.3{\%}; stage 3, 8.6{\%} vs. 15.3{\%}; and stage 4, 0{\%} vs. 3.4{\%}).

In summary, our series showed a relatively common occurrence of LT in patients with PTC, and we believed that lymphocytic infiltration developed mainly in response to the tumor itself. We also found a more favorable course of PTC in the presence of LT; this supports the hypothesis that lymphocytic infiltration represents a form of immune reaction to control tumor growth and proliferation.},

abstract = {The present study characterized involuntary movements associated with levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LID) in patients with Parkinson's disease. We used amplitude, proportional energy, frequency dispersion and sample entropy to determine whether LID movement patterns are truly random, as clinical description seems to suggest, or possess some underlying pattern that is not visible to the naked eye. LID was captured using a magnetic tracker system, which provided 3D rendering of whole-body LID. Patients were instructed to maintain a standing position, with arms extended in front of them. We compared the measurements of the dyskinetic PD group (DPD) with 10 patients without dyskinesias (NDPD) and 10 control subjects. In comparison to the other two groups, movement patterns from the DPD group had significantly higher amplitude, confirming the presence of dyskinesias. In addition, higher frequency components in the power spectrum of velocity were detected, suggestive of higher velocity in LID movement. Furthermore, there was a concentration in narrow frequency bands, which suggested stable oscillatory activity. Finally, sample entropy revealed more regularity in the DPD group. Although not statistically significant, we found that the amplitude from the NDPD group had a tendency to be smaller than those of controls. As well, the spectra were often more dispersed for the NDPD group. In conclusion, the present results suggest that LID cannot be considered as purely random movement since they possess some deterministic pattern of motion. This may provide a way for patients to adapt to these involuntary movements while performing voluntary motor acts.},

To get a quantitative measure of dynamical transition patterns of IP-network traffic, we used the values of determinism (DET) defined by the recurrence quantification analysis (RQA). Also, when evaluating the fractal-based properties of IP-network traffic, we focused on two parameters: (i) the long-range dependence (LRD)-related scaling parameter {\&}alpha; derived from the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) and (ii) the range of the generalized fractal dimension. In applying this method to traffic analysis, we performed two kinds of traffic measurement in Tokyo, Japan, and derived the values of DET and fractal-based parameters of IP-network traffic over time. In checking the measured network traffic, we found that the characteristic with respect to DET and self-similarity seen in the measured network traffic fluctuated over time, with different time-variation patterns for two measurement locations. Results also confirmed that a larger value of DET or accumulated DET reflected increases in the degree of LRD of IP-network traffic and that the accumulated DET reflected the decreases in the degree of multi-fractality of IP-network traffic. As a result, we confirmed that RP-based measures can be effective for evaluating the non-stationary transition patterns of IP-network traffic in terms of quantitative fractal-based properties.},

RQA was applied to EEG signals during sleep stages 1, 2, slow wave sleep (SWS), REM and the stage 'awake.' The sleep EEG signals were obtained from the MIT-BIH polysomnographic database. To examine the differences in the RQA measures for all sleep stages, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post hoc analysis were performed. From the results, all sleep stages could be distinctly discriminated by means of the RQA measure of {\%}RATIO. We observed that stage 1 and REM had fewer recurrences, and that stage 2 was more autocorrelated than the other stages. The different dynamic behaviors of wakefulness and sleep EEG were also observed. Of significant interest was the observation that RQA was able to distinguish stage 1 from REM. In conclusion, we suggest that the information obtained from RQA of sleep EEGs in sleep apnea syndrome is valuable for its analysis, and that RQA constitutes a useful tool for analyzing sleep EEGs in subjects with sleep apnea syndrome.},

Many cases which powerfully suggest nonlinear deterministic behaviour have not been recorded over time-spans which allow their exhaustive examination. The present investigation centred on a previously recorded robust and generic oscillation, but more recent and more discerning tests were applied. Despite hints that a low embedding dimension might suffice, the data appeared on most indices high-dimensional. A U-shaped return map was found and modelled using both radial basis functions and polynomials, but lack of detailed structure in the map prevented effective parameter estimation. On the basis of power-law rather than exponential divergence of nearby trajectories, and of inability to discriminate against behaviour which would also be manifested by a surrogate consisting of a noise-perturbed nonlinear periodic oscillator, it is concluded that the data do not support the idea that the aperiodicity in the particular oscillation examined is caused by deterministic chaos. There was evidence that the distributed nature of the physical system might underlie aspects of the high dimensionality. We advocate equally searching testing of any future candidate chaotic oscillations in the investigation of collapsed-tube flows.},

The theory of nonlinear dynamical systems, also called 'chaos theory', has now progressed to a stage, where it becomes possible to study self-organization and pattern formation in the complex neuronal networks of the brain. One approach to nonlinear time series analysis consists of reconstructing, from time series of EEG or MEG, an attractor of the underlying dynamical system, and characterizing it in terms of its dimension (an estimate of the degrees of freedom of the system), or its Lyapunov exponents and entropy (reflecting unpredictability of the dynamics due to the sensitive dependence on initial conditions). More recently developed nonlinear measures characterize other features of local brain dynamics (forecasting, time asymmetry, determinism) or the nonlinear synchronization between recordings from different brain regions.{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}Nonlinear time series has been applied to EEG and MEG of healthy subjects during no-task resting states, perceptual processing, performance of cognitive tasks and different sleep stages. Many pathologic states have been examined as well, ranging from toxic states, seizures, and psychiatric disorders to Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Cre1utzfeldt-Jakob's disease. Interpretation of these results in terms of 'functional sources' and 'functional networks' allows the identification of three basic patterns of brain dynamics: (i) normal, ongoing dynamics during a no-task, resting state in healthy subjects; this state is characterized by a high dimensional complexity and a relatively low and fluctuating level of synchronization of the neuronal networks; (ii) hypersynchronous, highly nonlinear dynamics of epileptic seizures; (iii) dynamics of degenerative encephalopathies with an abnormally low level of between area synchronization. Only intermediate levels of rapidly fluctuating synchronization, possibly due to critical dynamics near a phase transition, are associated with normal information processing, whereas both hyper--as well as hyposynchronous states result in impaired information processing and disturbed consciousness.},

In the case of the proteins, this approach is severely hampered by the need to take into consideration in a meaningful way the actual sequence of the aminoacid residues. From a purely mathematical perspective, the protein sequences can be viewed as a time series, where the role of time is played by the order of the aminoacid residues along the sequences. In turn, each individual residue can be considered as a single organic molecule that can be represented by the classical molecular descriptors. Thus, in principle the generation of order-dependent synthetic descriptors through the application of time series analysis can be used for building QSAR-like models of proteins. As a matter of fact, Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) of hydrophobicity-coded sequences of proteins has already been demonstrated to be useful in protein science.

abstract = {Neuronal activities of the reticular formation (RF) of the lower brainstem and the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS, first relay station of baroreceptor afferents) were recorded together in the anesthized dog with related parameters of EEG, respiration and cardiovascular system. The RF neurons are part of the common brainstem system (CBS) which participates in regulation and coordination of cardiovascular, respiratory, somatomotor systems, and vigilance. Multiple time series of these physiological subsystems yield useful information about internal dynamic coordination of the organism. Essential problems are nonlinearity and instationarity of the signals, due to the dynamic complexity of the systems. Several time-resolving methods are presented to describe nonlinear dynamic couplings in the time course, particularly during phase transitions. The methods are applied to the recorded signals representing the complex couplings of the physiological subsystems. Phase transitions in these systems are detected by recurrence plots of the instationary signals. The pointwise transinformation and the pointwise conditional coupling divergence are measures of the mutual interaction of the subsystems in the state space. If the signals show marked rhythms, instantaneous frequencies and their shiftings are demonstrated by time frequency distributions, and instantaneous phase differences show couplings of oscillating subsystems. Transient signal components are reconstructed by wavelet packet time selective transient reconstruction. These methods are useful means for analyzing coupling characteristics of the complex physiological system, and detailed analyses of internal dynamic coordination of subsystems become possible. During phase transitions of the functional organization (a) the rhythms of the central neuronal activities and the peripheral systems are altered, (b) changes in the coupling between CBS neurons and cardiovascular signals, respiration and the EEG, and (c) between NTS neurons (influenced by baroreceptor afferents) and CBS neurons occur, and (d) the processing of baroreceptor input at the NTS neurons changes. The results of this complex analysis, which could not be done formerly in this manner, confirm and complete former investigations on the dynamic organization of the CBS with its changing relations to peripheral and other central nervous subsystems.},

Coupling of two such similar systems gives rise to rich dynamics if the coupling also belongs to a delayed class. This gives rise to varieties of synchronization channels $\backslash$u2013 such as anticipatory synchronization and retarded synchronization. As the coefficient of delayed term changes value, it is observed that anticipatory synchronization makes way to phase synchronization. The onset of these various mechanisms are tested by the computation of similarity function and probability of recurrence. In the study of phase synchronization the machinery of empirical mode decomposition (EMD) analysis is adapted and lastly maximal Lyapunov exponent is computed as a verifying criterion.},

Currently, research in short-term traffic forecasting deals with these phenomena either by smoothing them or by accounting for them by nonlinear models. But, these approaches lead to inefficient predictions particularly when the data exhibit intense oscillations or frequent shifts to boundary conditions (congestion). This paper offers a set of tools and methods to assess on underlying statistical properties of short-term traffic volume data, a topic that has largely been overlooked in traffic forecasting literature. Results indicate that the statistical characteristics of traffic volume can be identified from prevailing traffic conditions; for example, volume data exhibit frequent shifts from deterministic to stochastic structures as well as transitions between cyclic and strongly nonlinear behaviors. These findings could be valuable in the implementation of a variable prediction strategy according to the statistical characteristics of the prevailing traffic volume states.},

Digitized data were transferred to a PC for subsequent processing with analysis software. The acceleration time series data were analyzed linearly and nonlinearly.

Many models, however, fail to incorporate some basic features of the involved physiology. The authors' research using experimental data from ECGs analyzed by recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) suggest that some of these dynamics can be better modeled by singularities of differential equations, alternating with oscillations which result in multi-choice responses to excitations. ECGs of 34 healthy volunteers were recorded for 512 consecutive beats. Recurrence plots suggested discontinuities at the T-P interval, and the durations of the T-P and P-T intervals were manually calculated. Although the distributions of these two intervals were found to be similar (KS two sample test, p=NS), RQA demonstrated that the T-P Interval approached the embedding limit of pseudo random numbers [pseudo random=4; T-P=4; (95{\%} CI=3.64.3)]. This suggests the primary stochastic process of ECGs is located In the T-P interval and represents a singularity of the dynamics alternating with the determinism of the P-T interval. The dynamics are thus discontinuous and poorly represented by FFT and other, nonlinear transform techniques.},

abstract = {Recurrence plot analysis has been applied to heart rate variability (HRV) data to identify hidden rhythms and complex dynamical patterns of fluctuations. Since the autonomic nervous system (ANS) is the primary regulating factor of HRV, derived measures as well as structural and qualitative aspects of these plots may be associated to different states or changes in neural control. A procedural feature of recurrence plots requires reconstruction of the dynamics in an equivalent topological space. The unknown dimensionality of HRV dynamics confounds the interpretation of measures, such as percent recurrence, percent determinism or entropy that have been proposed to characterize these plots. We observed that the structural stability manifested by recurrence plots was largely independent of increasing embedding dimension so that faithful characterization was feasible without embedding.},

@article{chelidze2007,
abstract = {Recent methods of analysis of so called disordered systems show that many objects and processes that earlier were considered as completely random reveal clear evidence of having some ordered structure in both time and space. These new methods (fractals, percolation, nonlinear dynamics and complexity theories) allow visualization and quantitative assessment of the level of complexity (orderliness) of these structures, using both theoretical models and experimental data. We consider sequentially some aspects of structural and evolutionary complexity of dynamics of seismic process and the technique of measuring this property. It is shown that the physical properties of geophysical medium are not always self-consistent and manifest fractal behavior on selected spatial and temporal scales. Mechanical percolation theory can be used for modeling geometry of fracture process. Namely, we consider fractal and connectivity aspects of delayed failure, including energy emission during fracturing. Special attention is paid to relating the intensity of geophysical anomalies to the strain in the framework of the pressure-induced anomalous strain-sensitivity (percolation) model, which explains naturally the observed heterogeneity of response of a geophysical media to the strain variation. Different methods of measuring the dynamic complexity of seismological time series are applied to magnitude and waiting time sequences of Caucasian earthquakes. The fractal (correlation) dimension d{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} of the latter is high (larger than 8), but the former one has as low dimension as 1.6-2.5, which makes waiting time sequences a promising tool for revealing precursory changes. The same nonlinear technique allow detecting significant changes in the seismic regime during external electromagnetic forcing by MHD pulses; similar tests on the laboratory scale show the possibility of triggering/controlling stick-slip process by relatively weak electromagnetic or mechanical forcing. Lastly, the predictive potential of complexity analysis of seismological time series is considered. For example, percolation model predicts the increase of the number of large events and the scatter of magnitudes of events, decrease of the magnitude-frequency relation slope and appearance of multifractality at approaching the final rupture. It seems that seismology can benefit from using the new techniques to cope with the complexity of earthquake machine; for example, the measures of complexity can be characteristic for a given region and change before strong earthquake.},

We show that these surrogates are well suited to test for complex synchronization, which makes it possible to systematically assess the reliability of synchronization analyses. We then apply the TS to study binocular fixational movements and find strong indications that the fixational movements of the left and right eye are phase synchronized. This result indicates that there might be only one centre in the brain that produces the fixational movements in both eyes or a close link between the two centres.},

abstract = {Heart rate variability (HRV) is a reliable reflection of the many physiological factors modulating the normal rhythm of the heart. In fact, they provide a powerful means of observing the interplay between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. It shows that the structure generating the signal is not only simply linear, but also involves nonlinear contributions. Heart rate (HR) is a nonstationary signal; its variation may contain indicators of current disease, or warnings about impending cardiac diseases. The indicators may be present at all times or may occur at random--during certain intervals of the day. It is strenuous and time consuming to study and pinpoint abnormalities in voluminous data collected over several hours. Hence, HR variation analysis (instantaneous HR against time axis) has become a popular noninvasive tool for assessing the activities of the autonomic nervous system. Computer based analytical tools for in-depth study of data over daylong intervals can be very useful in diagnostics. Therefore, the HRV signal parameters, extracted and analyzed using computers, are highly useful in diagnostics. In this paper, we have discussed the various applications of HRV and different linear, frequency domain, wavelet domain, nonlinear techniques used for the analysis of the HRV.},

abstract = {The study of transitory signals and local variability structures in both/either time and space and their role as sources of climatic memory, is an important but often neglected topic in climate research despite its obvious importance and extensive coverage in the literature. Transitory signals arise either from non-linearities, in the climate system, transitory atmosphere-ocean couplings, and other processes in the climate system evolving after a critical threshold is crossed. These temporary interactions that, though intense, may not last long, can be responsible for a large amount of unexplained variability but are normally considered of limited relevance and often, discarded. With most of the current techniques at hand these typology of signatures are difficult to isolate because the low signal-to-noise ratio in midlatitudes, the limited recurrence of the transitory signals during a customary interval of data considered. Also, there is often a serious problem arising from the smoothing of local or transitory processes if statistical techniques are applied, that consider all the length of data available, rather than taking into account the size of the specific variability structure under investigation. Scale-dependent correlation (SDC) analysis is a new statistical method capable of highlighting the presence of transitory processes, these former being understood as temporary significant lag-dependent autocovariance in a single series, or covariance structures between two series. This approach, therefore, complements other approaches such as those resulting from the families of wavelet analysis, singular-spectrum analysis and recurrence plots. A main feature of SDC is its high-performance for short time series, its ability to characterize phase-relationships and thresholds in the bivariate domain. Ultimately, SDC helps tracking short-lagged relationships among processes that locally or temporarily couple and uncouple. The use of SDC is illustrated in the present paper by means of some synthetic time-series examples of increasing complexity, and it is compared with wavelet analysis in order to provide a well-known reference of its capabilities. A comparison between SDC and companion techniques is also addressed and results are exemplified for the specific case of some relevant El Ni?-Southern Oscillation teleconnections.},

In our approach, splogs are recognized by their temporal characteristics and content. There are three key ideas in our splog detection framework. (a) We represent the blog temporal dynamics using self-similarity matrices defined on the histogram intersection similarity measure of the time, content, and link attributes of posts, to investigate the temporal changes of the post sequence. (b) We study the blog temporal characteristics using a visual representation derived from the self-similarity measures. The visual signature reveals correlation between attributes and posts, depending on the type of blogs (normal blogs and splogs). (c) We propose two types of novel temporal features to capture the splog temporal characteristics. In our splog detector, these novel features are combined with content based features. We extract a content based feature vector from blog home pages as well as from different parts of the blog. The dimensionality of the feature vector is reduced by Fisher linear discriminant analysis. We have tested an SVM-based splog detector using proposed features on real world datasets, with appreciable results (90{\%} accuracy).},

A computer-based intelligent system for analysis of cardiac states is very useful in diagnostics and disease management. Like many bio-signals, HRV signals are nonlinear in nature. Higher order spectral analysis (HOS) is known to be a good tool for the analysis of nonlinear systems and provides good noise immunity.

We present some general characteristics for each of these classes of HRV signals in the bispectrum and bicoherence plots.

abstract = {Secondary structures of proteins were studied by recurrence quantification analysis (RQA). High-resolution, 3-dimensional coordinates of alpha-carbon atoms comprising a set of 68 proteins were downloaded from the Protein Data Bank. By fine-tuning four recurrence parameters (radius, line, residue, separation), it was possible to establish excellent agreement between percent contribution of alpha-helix and beta-sheet structures determined independently by RQA and that of the DSSP algorithm (Define Secondary Structure of Proteins). These results indicate that there is an equivalency between these two techniques, which are based upon totally different pattern recognition strategies. RQA enhances qualitative contact maps by quantifying the arrangements of recurrent points of alpha carbons close in 3-dimensional space. For example, the radius was systematically increased, moving the analysis beyond local alpha-carbon neighborhoods in order to capture super-secondary and tertiary structures. However, differences between proteins could only be detected within distances up to about 6-11 {\&}Aring;, but not higher. This result underscores the complexity of alpha-carbon spacing when super-secondary structures appear at larger distances. Finally, RQA-defined secondary structures were found to be robust against random displacement of alpha carbons upwards of 1 {\&}Aring;. This finding has potential import for the dynamic functions of proteins in motion.},

abstract = {Information on motor strategies can be extracted from the surface electromyogram (EMG) by non-linear methods. The percentage of determinism ({\%}DET) obtained from recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) may be a sensitive variable to detect synchronous motor unit behaviour. The purpose of the present study was to validate this methodology by comparing it with an established technique estimating the degree of synchronization of pairs of voluntary activated motor units from the correlation of their firing in the time-domain. Single motor unit activity was recorded in extensor carpi radialis (ECR) muscle by pairs of tungsten microelectrodes inserted into the muscle belly. Cross-correlation analysis was performed in order to determine synchronization peak area by computing synchronous impulse probability. Surface EMG activity was recorded in parallel by electrodes placed over the skin of the same muscle and {\%}DET was used as a measure of synchronous activity. The {\%}DET appeared to be a valid measure of synchronization yielding results comparable to those obtained with cross-correlation analysis. Increases in {\%}DET ({\textless}i{\textgreater}t{\textless}/i{\textgreater} = 64.59, {\textless}i{\textgreater}P{\textless}/i{\textgreater} {\textless} 0.0001) highly correlated ({\textless}i{\textgreater}r{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} = 0.70, {\textless}i{\textgreater}P{\textless}/i{\textgreater} = 0.0013) with pharmacologically induced increases in the synchronization activity of pairs of ECR motor units ({\textless}i{\textgreater}t{\textless}/i{\textgreater} = 8.71, {\textless}i{\textgreater}P{\textless}/i{\textgreater} {\textless} 0.0001).

We have detected strong evidences that microseism time series are stochastic, and no evidence of nonlinearity and/or determinism has been found. In order to get more insight on the underlying mechanism, we tested a toy model that reproduces some observable characteristics of the microseisms. This toy model consists in a forced, damped nonlinear oscillator in which the force term is composed of two harmonic forces and additive white noise. We have concluded that noise contribution is of fundamental importance in modeling the spectral properties of observed time series, and assimilate it to the ubiquitous local, high frequency noise. A global mechanism for microseism generation is suggested in terms of atmospheric turbulence at different wavelengths.},

abstract = {The spontaneous low- and high-frequency rhythms in the sympathetic discharge of decerebrate artificially ventilated cats are affected by external ventilation. Two graphical methods (i.e. the space-time separation plot and the frequency tracking locus) are used to classify the non-linear interactions. The observed behaviours in the sympathetic discharge consist of phase-locked periodic dynamics (at various frequency ratios with ventilation), quasiperiodic and aperiodic patterns. They depend on the experimental condition. In control condition the sympathetic discharge appears more frequently locked to each ventilatory cycle (1 : 1 dynamics). However, some cases of quasiperiodic dynamics are found. A sympathetic activation stimulus, such as inferior vena cava occlusion, is able to synchronise slow rhythms in the sympathetic discharge to a subharmonic of ventilation. During a sympathetic inhibition stimulus, such as aortic constriction, 1 : 1 dynamics is detected but the amplitude of the sympathetic responses can be modulated by unlocked slow rhythms. Moreover, some cases of aperiodic dynamics are observed. Vagotomy reduces the 1 : 1 coupling between sympathetic outflow and ventilation. Vagotomy plus spinalisation disrupts periodic dynamics in the sympathetic discharge so that irregular and complex patterns are found.},

abstract = {In the light of results obtained during the last two decades in a number of laboratories, it appears that some of the tools of nonlinear dynamics, first developed and improved for the physical sciences and engineering, are well-suited for studies of biological phenomena. In particular it has become clear that the different regimes of activities undergone by nerve cells, neural assemblies and behavioural patterns, the linkage between them, and their modifications over time, cannot be fully understood in the context of even integrative physiology, without using these new techniques. This report, which is the first of two related papers, is aimed at introducing the non expert to the fundamental aspects of nonlinear dynamics, the most spectacular aspect of which is chaos theory. After a general history and definition of chaos the principles of analysis of time series in phase space and the general properties of chaotic trajectories will be described as will be the classical measures which allow a process to be classified as chaotic in ideal systems and models. We will then proceed to show how these methods need to be adapted for handling experimental time series; the dangers and pitfalls faced when dealing with non stationary and often noisy data will be stressed, and specific criteria for suspecting determinism in neuronal cells and/or assemblies will be described. We will finally address two fundamental questions, namely i) whether and how can one distinguish, deterministic patterns from stochastic ones, and, ii) what is the advantage of chaos over randomness: we will explain why and how the former can be controlled whereas, notoriously, the latter cannot be tamed. In the second paper of the series, results obtained at the level of single cells and their membrane conductances in real neuronal networks and in the study of higher brain functions, will be critically reviewed. It will be shown that the tools of nonlinear dynamics can be irreplaceable for revealing hidden mechanisms subserving, for example, neuronal synchronization and periodic oscillations. The benefits for the brain of adopting chaotic regimes with their wide range of potential behaviours and their aptitude to quickly react to changing conditions will also be considered.},

In this paper, one of the possible applications of recurrence plot strategy to the analysis of sEMG is described. Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) is an efficient time-series analysis tool pertaining to the class of non-linear dynamics time-domain processing. We analysed sEMG recorded on the biceps brachii during isometric contraction both at constant (CF) and non constant force (NCF). For comparison purposes, experimental data were analysed over epochs of 1 s so that the hypothesis of sEMG stationarity could be accepted. The analysis concerned one of the most widely used frequency parameters (namely the median frequency, MDF) and one parameter (i.e., the percent determinism {\%}DET) extracted using the non-linear technique. Our main results are: (i) the gross average evaluated for all subjects on {\%}DET data shows a comparable variation with respect to MDF throughout the course of CF experiments; (ii) {\%}DET seems able to detect motor unit (MU) synchronisation; (iii) during non constant force experiments, {\%}DET is more effective than MDF in detecting sEMG changes determined by brisk transients of force output.},

OKN appears to have some nonlinear and deterministic component, along with significant randomness. Fast phase starting and ending points are somewhat predictable (deterministic), while so-called 'exceptional events' analysis shows that they also have a large random component. Surrogate data methods suggest that the population of slow and fast phases in OKN is more important than any specific relationship between adjacent slow and fast phases. Analysis of a statistical model for fast phase intervals indicates that the model data are slightly more random than the actual OKN. },

First, we reconstruct the phase space from the sound recording and thereby reveal that the attractor needs no less than five degrees of freedom to fully evolve in the embedding space, which suggests that a rather complex nonlinear dynamics underlies its existence. Prior to investigating the dynamics more precisely, we test whether the reconstructed attractor satisfies the notions of determinism and stationarity, as a lack of either of these properties would preclude a meaningful further analysis. After positively establishing determinism and stationarity, we proceed by showing that the maximal Lyapunov exponent of the recording is positive, which is a strong indicator for the chaotic behavior of the system, confirming that dynamical nonlinearities are an integral part of the examined sound-producing apparatus.

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to develop a submaximal repetitive isoinertial back muscle endurance test by defining the relationships between the power spectral indices of paraspinal muscle electromyographic (EMG) activities, endurance time and a subjective estimate of fatigue (Borg scale). Bilateral surface EMG recordings were obtained over the lumbar paraspinal muscles in ten individuals who were currently free from back pain. All subjects performed repetitive upper trunk extensions (25? flexion and 5? extension, 30 repetitions per min), while movement below the third lumbar vertebral body was mechanically restricted. The load level depended upon upper body mass, sex, and age. The tests continued for as long as the subjects were able to maintain the required repetition rate (endurance time). Median (MF) and mean power frequency (MPF) slopes were calculated by performing a fast Fourier transformation after confirmation of EMG stationarity by recurrence quantification analysis. MF and MPF correlations with endurance time/Borg scale were measured for the first 60 s (0.60-0.88/0.42-0.86), the first 90 s (0.62-0.89/0.52-0.90), the first 120 s (0.50-0.76/0.41-0.73), and the entire repetitive run (0.63-0.88/0.54-0.90). To test for the reproducibility of the spectral indices, EMGs were recorded for 2 min during repetitive loading from the same subjects on two consecutive days. Corresponding spectral slopes of MF and MPF were correlated at 60 s (0.36-0.93), 90 s (0.58-0.92), and 120 s (0.70-0.94) at the L3-L4 and L5-S1 levels, indicating good reproducibility of results from alternate recording sessions at the L5-S1 level. It is concluded that paraspinal muscle spectral indices (MF and MPF) measured before the onset of total muscle fatigue are good predictors of endurance time and are closely related to the subjective perception of fatigue.},

Furthermore, this approach demonstrates to be efficient in recognizing regular and chaotic trajectories of dynamical systems with mixed phase space. Regarding the application to real situations, I have shown the capability and validity of this method by analyzing time series from fluid experiments.},

In normal subjects, a clear scaling of determinism with increasing stimulation intensity was observed in the click intensity range from 41 to 59 dB. Outside that range and, in particular, above its upper end, subject-dependent features appeared in the form of different maximal levels of determinism. A comparative analysis of responses from hearing-impaired subjects with conductive hearing losses and sensorineural hearing losses suggested that the principal contributor to this behavior is the middle ear and allowed us to discriminate the two pathologies solely on the basis of CEOAEs. These observations are consistent with a simple phenomenological model of the auditory periphery in which different functional modules are sequentially recruited at increasing stimulus intensities, with a consequent rise in CEOAE coherence.},

abstract = {Recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) can extract the dynamics of postural control from center of pressure (CoP) data by quantifying the system's repeatability, complexity, and local dynamic stability through several variables. Computation of these variables requires the selection of suitable embedding parameters for state space reconstruction (i.e. time delay and embedding dimension); however, it is unclear how the parameters influence RQA variables when examining noisy CoP data. This study evaluated the sensitivity of RQA variables to embedding parameter values and noise level, and assessed methods of selecting embedding parameters for CoP data. Five healthy male subjects maintained quiet stance for 30 s while the anterior$\backslash$u2013posterior CoP was measured. The effect of noise was evaluated by adding uniform white noise of increasing amplitude to the raw CoP signal. The magnitude of all RQA variables decreased with increasing noise amplitude for all subjects. A sensitivity analysis was performed by systematically altering the embedding parameters for the raw data with and without a selected level of added noise. The key result was that, for all subjects, the RQA variables were sensitive to the embedding parameter values and the level of noise in the CoP data. Finally, the performance of false nearest neighbors and average displacement algorithms for choosing embedding parameters was evaluated. Both methods gave clear and consistent results for all subjects with either raw or noisy data. The results suggest that careful selection of embedding parameters is essential when using RQA to examine postural control based on noisy CoP data.},

time series from complex systems. Starting from the concept of recurrences in
phase space, the recurrence matrix of a time series is interpreted as the
adjacency matrix of an associated complex network which links different points
in time if the evolution of the considered states is very similar. A critical
comparison of these recurrence networks with similar existing techniques is
presented, revealing strong conceptual benefits of the new approach which can
be considered as a unifying framework for transforming time series into complex
networks that also includes other methods as special cases.
It is demonstrated that there are fundamental relationships between the
topological properties of recurrence networks and the statistical properties of
the phase space density of the underlying dynamical system. Hence, the network
description yields new quantitative characteristics of the dynamical complexity
of a time series, which substantially complement existing measures of
recurrence quantification analysis.},

The major difficulties are pointed out that arise when the data cannot be assumed to be purely deterministic and the potential that remains in this situation is discussed. For signals with weakly nonlinear structure, the presence of nonlinearity in a general sense has to be inferred statistically. The paper reviews the relevant methods and discusses the implications for deterministic modeling. Most field measurements yield nonstationary time series, which poses a severe problem for their analysis. Recent progress in the detection and understanding of nonstationarity is reported. If a clear signature of approximate determinism is found, the notions of phase space, attractors, invariant manifolds, etc., provide a convenient framework for time series analysis. Although the results have to be interpreted with great care, superior performance can be achieved for typical signal processing tasks. In particular, prediction and filtering of signals are discussed, as well as the classification of system states by means of time series recordings.},

abstract = {We introduce a novel non-parametric methodology to test for the dynamical time evolution of the lag-lead structure between two arbitrary time series. The method consists of constructing a distance matrix based on the matching of all sample data pairs between the two time series. Then, the lag-lead structure is searched for as the optimal path in the distance matrix landscape that minimizes the total mismatch between the two time series, and that obeys a one-to-one causal matching condition. To make the solution robust to the presence of a large amount of noise that may lead to spurious structures in the distance matrix landscape, we generalize this optimal search by introducing a fuzzy search by sampling over all possible paths, each path being weighted according to a multinomial logit or equivalently Boltzmann factor proportional to the exponential of the global mismatch of this path. We present the efficient transfer matrix method that solves the problem and test it on simple synthetic examples to demonstrate its properties and usefulness compared with the standard running-time cross-correlation method. We then apply our 'optimal thermal causal path' method to the question of the lag-dependence between the US stock market and the treasury bond yields and confirm our earlier results on an arrow of the stock markets preceding the Federal Reserve Funds' adjustments, as well as the yield rates at short maturities in the period 2000-2003. Our application of this technique to inflation, inflation change, GDP growth rate and unemployment rate unearths non-trivial lag relationships: the GDP changes lead inflation especially since the 1980s, inflation changes leads GDP only in the 1980 decade, and inflation leads unemployment rates since the 1970s. In addition, our approach seems to detect multiple competing lag structures in which one can have inflation leading GDP with a certain lag time and GDP feeding back/leading inflation with another lag time.},

This area is seismically active and a catalogue with about 14100 events from 1975 to 1996 has been analyzed. The seismic catalogue was divided into three parts: 1975-1983 first part with no EM experiments, 1983-1990 second part during EM experiments and 1988-1996 after experiments part. Qualitative and quantitative time series non-linear analysis was applied to waiting times of earthquakes to the above three sub catalogue periods. The qualitative approach includes visual inspection of reconstructed phase space, Iterated Function Systems (IFS) and Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA). The quantitative approach followed correlation integral calculation of reconstructed phase space of waiting time distribution, with noise reduction and surrogate testing methods. Moreover the Lempel-Ziv algorithmic complexity measure (LZC) was calculated. General dynamics of earthquakes' temporal distribution around the test area, reveals properties of low dimensional non linearity. Strong EM discharges lead to the increase in extent of regularity in earthquakes temporal distribution. After cessation of EM experiments the earthquakes' temporal distribution becomes much more random than before experiments. To avoid non valid conclusions several tests were applied to our data set: differentiation of the time series was applied to check results not affected by non stationarity; the surrogate data approach was followed to reject the hypothesis that dynamics belongs to the colored noise type. Small earthquakes, below completeness threshold, were added to the analysis to check results robustnesss.},

In human epilepsy the exact mechanisms underlying seizure generation are still uncertain as are mechanisms underlying seizure spreading and termination. There is now growing evidence that an improved understanding of the epileptic process can be achieved through the analysis of properties of epileptic brain networks and through the analysis of interactions in such networks. In this overview, we summarize recent methodological developments to assess synchronization phenomena in human epileptic brain networks and present findings obtained from analyses of brain electromagnetic signals recorded in epilepsy patients.},

This paper uses discrete-event simulation to study networks that consist of a low number of cooperating manufacturers. The dynamics of the logistic parameters in the model are analyzed using methods originated in the theory of nonlinear dynamical systems.

The Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) characterizes various aspects of a dynamic system and makes it a suitable technique for feature extraction. We have taken three prime quantification techniques namely Recurrence Rate, Entropy and Average Diagonal Length. The information about the system gets distributed in these quantities. Hence we need a model that is capable of taking into account the information from all the three RQA techniques. Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) can model these information very efficiently. For this purpose we have used Factorial Hidden Markov Model (FHMM) which is a special case of DBNs.

abstract = {Over the past two decades, extensive research has been conducted on developing vehicle transmissions that meet the goals of reduced exhaust emissions and increased vehicle efficiency. A continuously variable transmission is an emerging automotive transmission technology that offers a continuum of gear ratios between desired limits. A chain CVT is a friction-limited drive whose dynamic performance and torque capacity rely significantly on the friction characteristic of the contact patch between the chain and the pulley. Although a CVT helps to maximize the vehicle fuel economy, its complete potential has not been accomplished in a mass-production vehicle. The present research focuses on developing models to analyze friction-induced nonlinear dynamics of a chain CVT drive and identify possible mechanisms that cause degradation of the overall dynamic performance by inducing chaos and self-sustained vibrations in the system. Two different mathematical models of friction, which characterize different operating or loading conditions, are embedded into a detailed planar multibody model of chain CVT in order to capture the various friction-induced effects in the system. Tools such as stick$\backslash$u2013slip oscillator dynamics, Lyapunov exponents, phase-space reconstruction, and recurrence plotting are incorporated to characterize the nonlinear dynamics of such a friction-limited system. The mathematical models, the computational scheme, and the results corresponding to different loading scenarios are discussed. The results discuss the influence of friction characteristics on the nonlinear dynamics and torque transmitting capacity of a chain CVT drive.},

abstract = {The paramyxovirus envelope fuses with the host cell membrane by cooperative interaction of two transmembrane glycoproteins: the hemagglutinin neuraminidase (HN) and the fusion (F) glycoprotein. The interaction appears to be finely regulated, as both proteins must derive from the same viral species to obtain a functional interaction. Because HN and F do not form stable complexes, this interaction is poorly characterized. This article demonstrates that a modification of a classical bioinformatic method based on the co-evolution of interacting partners can detect the specificity of the HN and F interaction. The proposed approach relies on a relatively new nonlinear signal analysis technique, recurrence quantification analysis (RQA), applied to the hydrophobicity sequences of viral proteins. This technique is able to shed light on the interaction between HN and F proteins in the virus-cell fusion and, more generally, permits the quantitative comparison of nonhomologue protein systems. On the contrary, the same co-evolution approach, based on the classical sequence alignment procedure, was unable to discriminate interacting partners from the general strict correlation existing between the evolution of viral proteins as a whole. The cooperation between HN and F in the fusion process is thus demonstrated by a bioinformatic, purely sequence-dependent, perspective.},

On the other hand FD was the index least affected by CV changes and most related to the level of synchronism (promising index of central fatigue). A representative application to some experimental signals from vastus lateralis muscle during an isometric endurance test supported the results of the simulations. The vector (ECV, FD) is suggested to provide selective indications of peripheral and central fatigue.

White noise is probably present in all physiological processes. In many cases, periodic variations are due to oscillations originating in chemoreflex feedback loops. It has long been hypothesized that correlated random variations in breathing pattern are due to central neutral "memory" mechanisms, but part of this behavior might be due to chemoreflex mechanisms. Recently it has been concluded that nonlinear interactions between pulmonary and airway afferent activities and integrative central respiratory mechanisms can produce nonrandom nonperiodic (and also periodic) variability of the respiratory pattern. These latter studies have provided new insights about the behavioral relevance of the integrative character of central respiratory mechanisms and the time-varying nature of pulmonary afferent activities and have emphasized the importance of identifying the physiological bases for these phenomena. These and other findings are interpreted assuming that respiratory rhythm generation/pattern formation occurs via a nonlinear oscillator, and novel inferences concerning temporal variations of the breathing pattern are proposed.},

One of the more important structures in a DNA sequence is repeat-related. Often they have to be masked before protein coding regions along a DNA sequence are to be identified or redundant expressed sequence tags (ESTs) are to be sequenced. Here we report a novel recurrence time based method for sequence analysis. The method can conveniently study all kinds of periodicity and exhaustively find all repeat-related features from a genomic DNA sequence. An efficient codon index is also derived from the recurrence time statistics, which has the salient features of being largely species-independent and working well on very short sequences. Efficient codon indices are key elements of successful gene finding algorithms, and are particularly useful for determining whether a suspected EST belongs to a coding or non-coding region. We illustrate the power of the method by studying the genomes of E. coli, the yeast S. cervisivae, the nematode worm C. elegans, and the human, Homo sapiens. Computationally, our method is very efficient. It allows us to carry out analysis of genomes on the whole genomic scale by a PC.},

In the present article we focus on the problem of defining a meaningful coupling strength using information-theoretic measures and demonstrate the shortcomings of the well-known mutual information and transfer entropy. Instead, we propose a certain time-delayed conditional mutual information, the momentary information transfer (MIT), as a lag-specific measure of association that is general, causal, reflects a well interpretable notion of coupling strength, and is practically computable. Rooted in information theory, MIT is general in that it does not assume a certain model class underlying the process that generates the time series. As discussed in a previous paper [ Phys. Rev. Lett. 108 258701 (2012)], the general framework of graphical models makes MIT causal in that it gives a nonzero value only to lagged components that are not independent conditional on the remaining process. Further, graphical models admit a low-dimensional formulation of conditions, which is important for a reliable estimation of conditional mutual information and, thus, makes MIT practically computable. MIT is based on the fundamental concept of source entropy, which we utilize to yield a notion of coupling strength that is, compared to mutual information and transfer entropy, well interpretable in that, for many cases, it solely depends on the interaction of the two components at a certain lag. In particular, MIT is, thus, in many cases able to exclude the misleading influence of autodependency within a process in an information-theoretic way. We formalize and prove this idea analytically and numerically for a general class of nonlinear stochastic processes and illustrate the potential of MIT on climatological data.},

We here propose a method that leads to the construction of a novel functional network, a multi-mode weighted graph combined with an empirical mode decomposition, and to the realization of multi-information fusion of multivariate time series. The method is illustrated in a couple of successful applications (a multi-phase flow and an epileptic electro-encephalogram), which demonstrate its powerfulness in revealing the dynamical behaviors underlying the transitions of different flow patterns, and enabling to differentiate brain states of seizure and non-seizure.},

    abstract = {Recurrence analysis is an effective tool to characterize and quantify the dynamics of complex systems, e.g., laminar, divergent or nonlinear transition behaviors. However, recurrence computation is highly expensive as the size of time series increases. Few, if any, previous approaches have been capable of quantifying the recurrence properties from a long-term time series, while which is often collected in the real-time monitoring of complex systems. This paper presents a novel multiscale framework to explore recurrence dynamics in complex systems and resolve computational issues for a large-scale dataset. As opposed to the traditional single-scale recurrence analysis, we characterize and quantify recurrence dynamics in multiple wavelet scales, which captures not only nonlinear but also nonstationary behaviors in a long-term time series. The proposed multiscale recurrence approach was utilized to identify heart failure subjects from the 24-h time series of heart rate variability (HRV). It was shown to identify the conditions of congestive heart failure with an average sensitivity of 92.1% and specificity of 94.7%. The proposed multiscale recurrence framework can be potentially extended to other nonlinear dynamic methods that are computationally expensive for large-scale datasets.},
