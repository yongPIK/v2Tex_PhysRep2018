Dear Yong and Juergen,

Attached below please find a referee report on your review for Physics Reports. 
The report is sufficiently adverse to compel me not to accept the review at this
stage. If you choose you can follow the suggestions of the referee to improve the
review considerably by adding substantial parts to discuss other groups' work
on the subject. Please do not answer with polemics against the referee, the
referee is a leading scholar in the field and I take his remarks seriously as you should.
If you choose to resubmit I will send the new version to the same referee to get
his/her approval that indeed the missing coverage had been added to the review.

Greetings, Itamar

*************
The Manuscript "Complex network approaches to nonlinear time series analysis"
is focusing on a subject of importance and relevance: the increasing power of computer 
technology does not dispense more and more scientists from extracting 
meaningful information out of data sets of ever growing size.  
Complex network representations of data may indeed be, in some cases, 
a good tool and offer practical solutions.

Unfortunately, the report got short in its aim: the content 
is almost limited to recurrence and transition networks, and visibility graphs 
(three important concepts introduced by the Authors), and almost exclusively 
centered on the Authors' contributions to the field.
For instance, a simple search on the .pdf leads to the following: 
68 References are co-authored by the fifth Author of the present Manuscript, 
47 by the third, 33 by the second, and 25 each by the first and fourth Author.

On the other hand, there are a lot of other (equally relevant) attempts and contributions, 
which are here instead neglected.
Just an example, M.Zanin et al. published two years ago another review on
Physics Reports (Phys. Rep. 635, 1-44 (2016) ) on almost the same subject (how to combine
complex networks and data mining techniques), with about 320 References,
most of them referring to methods for network reconstruction out of data,
methods and tools which are developed by several groups 
of computer scientists, nonlinear physicists, and applied mathematicians.
Another example is parenclitic networks, which were explicitly introduced with the
aim of providing a complex network representation of static data (Scientific Reports 4, 5112 (2014)), 
and found already few applications in biomedicine (F1000 Research 5, 2675 (2016)), 
and in epigenetics (PLoS ONE 12(1), e0169661 (2017)) .

In summary, it is not the intention of this Referee to deny that Authors have 
contributed prominent, relevant and useful concepts and methods to the field, 
whose importance has to be duly highlighted in a Manuscript having the scope
of reviewing the subject.
However, the present version of the report only provides a very partial account of
the state of the art, and my suggestion is to complete it with adding the
(many others) contributions that were offered to obtain a network reconstruction
from data sets.
